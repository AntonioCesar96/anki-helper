      <h1 class="cs">INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <div class="epigraph">
        <p class="epaft">“As in the first Epistle, the apostle does not immediately grapple with the error, but prepares the hearts of the saints gradually and on all sides so as to clench the truth and exclude the error once it is exposed. This is the way of divine grace and wisdom; the heart is set right, and not the mere point of error or evil dealt with.”</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-72" class="ahaft">I. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
      <p class="pf">The important truths found in this little Letter are both doctrinal and practical. Paul further explains and corrects the Thessalonians’ understanding of the Second Coming and the revelation about the man of sin. He also gives sound advice as to those who would use the Second Coming as an excuse not to work—don’t let them eat, either!</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-74" class="ah">II. Authorship</h2>
      <p class="paft">If anything, the <i class="calibre2">external evidence</i> for 2 Thessalonians is even stronger than for 1 Thessalonians. Not only is it attested early by Polycarp, Ignatius, and Justin (as well as being found in the Marcionite Prologue and the Muratorian Canon), but Irenaeus quotes 2 Thessalonians by name.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Since it is so short, the Epistle does not have as much <i class="calibre2">internal evidence</i> as 1 Thessalonians, but it does complement and agree so well with that Epistle that few scholars hesitate to accept its Pauline authorship.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-76" class="ah">III. Date</h2>
      <p class="paft">Second Thessalonians was written in response to further problems and also the misunderstanding of parts of 1 Thessalonians. A few months or even weeks are all that are needed to pass between the writing of the two Letters. Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy were still together (1:1), and Corinth is the only city where we read of their being together (Acts 18:1, 5). Hence the date is the early 50s, probably <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 50 or 51.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-78" class="ah">IV. Background and Themes</h2>
      <p class="paft">There were three principal reasons for another Letter, even so soon after the first. The saints were being persecuted and needed to be encouraged (chap. 1). They were being misled as to the Day of the Lord and needed to be enlightened (chap. 2). Some were living in idleness in view of the Lord’s Return and needed to be corrected (chap. 3).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">With regard to the Day of the Lord, the believers were fearful that they were already in it. Their fears were strengthened by false rumors to the effect that Paul himself was teaching that the Day was now present. So the apostle sets the record straight.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It should be apparent that the Day of the Lord is not the same as the coming of the Lord, that is, the Rapture. The saints were not fearful that the Lord had come; they were fearful that they were in the Tribulation, the first phase of the Day of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Paul had never taught that any events <i class="calibre2">had to occur before the Rapture</i>. But now he teaches that <i class="calibre2">before the Day of the Lord</i> begins, there will be a great apostasy, the restrainer will be removed, and the man of sin will be revealed.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">For the proper understanding of this Letter, nothing is more important than to see the distinction between the Rapture, the Day of the Lord, and Christ’s Coming to reign. The Day of the Lord is defined in the notes on 1 Thessalonians 5:2. The distinction between the Rapture and the Revelation is made in an Excursus at 2 Thessalonians 1:7.</p>

      <h3 id="calibre_link-36" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-4">A. Paul’s Debt of Thanks (1:3–5)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:3</span> The Letter begins with thanksgiving for the saints. To read this is to listen to the heartbeat of a true servant of Christ as he rejoices over his beloved spiritual children. To him thanksgiving was a continual duty to <b class="calibre5">God</b>, and it was an appropriate duty as well in view of the <b class="calibre5">faith</b> and <b class="calibre5">love</b> of the Christians. Their <b class="calibre5">faith</b> was making astonishing strides, and each one without exception was showing more and more <b class="calibre5">love</b> to the others. This was an answer to the apostle’s prayer (1 Thess. 3:10, 12).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Notice the order: first <b class="calibre5">faith</b>, then <b class="calibre5">love</b>. “Faith puts us in contact with the eternal spring of love in God Himself,” writes C. H. Mackintosh, “and the necessary consequence is that our hearts are drawn out in love to all who belong to Him.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:4</span> Their spiritual progress caused Paul and his associates to <b class="calibre5">boast</b> about them to other <b class="calibre5">churches of God</b>. They had remained steadfast and full of faith in spite of the <b class="calibre5">persecutions</b> they were enduring. <b class="calibre5">Patience</b> here means steadfastness or perseverance.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:5</span> The fact that they were standing up so bravely under the persecutions and afflictions was an indication of the <b class="calibre5">righteous</b> dealings <b class="calibre5">of God</b>. He was supporting them, strengthening them, encouraging them. If they had not received His divine power, they would never have been able to demonstrate such patience and faith in suffering for Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Their heroic endurance proved them <b class="calibre5">worthy of the kingdom of God</b>. It did not suggest that any personal merit entitled them to enter the kingdom; it is only through the merits of Christ that anyone will be there. But those who suffer on behalf of the kingdom here show that they are among those who will reign with Him in that coming day (Rom. 8:17; 2 Tim. 2:12).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">E. W. Rogers, in commenting on the phrase <b class="calibre5">you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God</b>, states:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">This has to do with human responsibility. On the side of divine sovereignty we have been made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, and this meetness is solely due to our association with Christ in His death and resurrection. We are graced in the Beloved, altogether independent of anything in ourselves, either before or since we were saved. But God allows His people to go through persecutions and tribulations in order to develop in them the moral excellencies which make them “worthy citizens” of that kingdom.</p>
        <p class="sb">Some of the apostles rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer for Jesus’ name. Paul’s prayer for the Thessalonians that God would count them worthy of their calling most certainly had nothing to do with adding anything to the work of Christ. The Cross makes the believer worthy of his position in the kingdom, but patience and faith in tribulation manifest such an one as morally worthy of it. Among members of any earthly society there are those who are discreditable as well as others. Paul prayed that it should not be so among these saints.<a id="calibre_link-56" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-5">2</a></p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-37" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-6">B. The Righteous Judgment of God (1:6–10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:6</span> The <b class="calibre5">righteous</b> action of <b class="calibre5">God</b> is seen in two ways—punishment for the persecutors and then rest for the persecuted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Williams says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">God’s action in allowing His people to be persecuted, and in permitting the existence of their persecutors, had a double purpose—first, to test the fitness of His people for government (v. 5); and second, to manifest the fitness of their persecutors for judgment.<a id="calibre_link-57" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-7">3</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:7</span> Just as God will mete out punishment to the enemies of His people, so He will award <b class="calibre5">rest</b> to those who suffer for His sake.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">We should not conclude from verse 7 that suffering saints will not obtain relief from trial until Christ comes back from heaven in flaming fire. When a believer dies, he obtains rest. Living believers will enjoy relaxation from all tensions at the time of the Rapture. What this verse is saying is that when the Lord pours out judgment on His adversaries, the saints will be seen by the world to be enjoying <b class="calibre5">rest</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The time of God’s righteous retribution is <b class="calibre5">when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels</b>. Retribution for the ungodly and <b class="calibre5">rest</b> for believers are included in His coming. Which phase of Christ’s coming is referred to here? It is clearly the third phase—the <i class="calibre2">manifestation</i> of His coming, when He returns with His saints to the earth.</p>

        <p class="sb">Granted then that these are two separate events, yet how do we know that they do not occur at approximately the same time? How do we know that they are separated by an interval? Three lines of proof can be mentioned:</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. The first is based on Daniel’s prophecy of seventy weeks (Dan. 9:25–27). We are now living in the parenthetical Church Age, between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks. The seventieth week is the Tribulation Period of seven years. The church is taken home to heaven before the Tribulation Period (Rom. 5:9; 1 Thess. 1:10; 1 Thess. 5:9; Rev. 3:10). The coming of Christ to reign takes place after the seventieth week (Dan. 9:24; Matt. 24).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. The second line of proof for an interval of time between the Rapture and the Manifestation is based on the structure of the book of Revelation. In the first three chapters, the church is seen on earth. Chapters 4 through 19:10 describe the Tribulation Period when God’s wrath will be poured out on the world that has rejected His Son. The church is never mentioned as being on earth during this period. The church is apparently taken to heaven at the close of chapter 3. In Revelation 19:11, Christ returns to earth to subdue His foes and to set up His kingdom—at the close of the Tribulation Period.</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="3">3. There is a third consideration which necessitates a time interval between Christ’s coming <i class="calibre2">for</i> the saints and His coming <i class="calibre2">with</i> the saints. At the time of the Rapture, <i class="calibre2">all</i> believers are taken out of the world and are given their glorified bodies. Yet when Christ returns to reign, there will be believers on earth who will not as yet have glorified bodies and who will marry and raise children during the Millennium (Isa. 11:6, 8). Where do these believers come from? There must be a period of time between the Rapture and the Revelation during which they are converted.</li>

      <p class="calibre3">Now to return to verse 7, we have the arrival of <b class="calibre5">the Lord Jesus</b> in power and great glory. He is attended by <b class="calibre5">angels</b> through whom His power is exerted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:8</span> The <b class="calibre5">flaming fire</b> may be a reference to the Shekinah, the glory cloud which symbolizes God’s presence (Ex. 16:10). Or it may be a picture of the fiery judgment which is about to be unleashed (Ps. 50:3; Isa. 66:15). Probably it is the latter.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">When God takes <b class="calibre5">vengeance</b>, it is not vindictiveness, but righteous recompense. There is no thought of “getting even” but rather of meting out the punishment which His holy, righteous character demands. He has no pleasure in the death of the wicked (Ezek. 18:32).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Paul describes two classes marked out for retribution:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. <b class="calibre5">Those who do not know God</b>—those who have rejected the knowledge of the true God as revealed in creation and in conscience (Rom. 1, 2). They may never have heard the gospel.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="2">2. <b class="calibre5">Those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>—those who have heard the gospel and have rejected it. The gospel is not simply a statement of facts to be believed, but a Person to be obeyed. Belief in the NT sense involves obedience.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:9</span> <b class="calibre5">These shall be punished</b>. A god who doesn’t punish sin is no god at all. The idea that a God of love must not punish sin overlooks the fact that God is also holy and must do what is morally right.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The nature of the punishment is here defined as <b class="calibre5">everlasting destruction</b>. The word translated “everlasting” or “eternal” (<span class="calibre2">aiōnios</span>) is used seventy times in the NT. Three times it may mean “ages of limited duration” (Rom. 16:25; 2 Tim. 1:9; Tit. 1:2). The other times it means eternal or endless. It is used in Romans 16:26 to describe the unending existence of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">Destruction</b> never means annihilation. It means loss of well-being, or ruin as far as the purpose of existence is concerned. The wineskins which the Lord Jesus described in Luke 5:37 were “destroyed” (same root word as used here). They did not cease to exist, but they were ruined as far as further usefulness was concerned.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">This passage is often used by post-tribulationists to confirm their position. They understand it to say that believers will not obtain rest and their persecutors will not be punished until Christ comes back to reign, and this is admittedly at the end of the Tribulation. Therefore, they conclude that the hope of believers is the post-tribulation Rapture.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">What they fail to see is that the Thessalonians to whom this was written have all died and are already enjoying rest with the Lord in heaven. Likewise, their persecutors have all died and are already suffering in Hades.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Why then does Paul seem to say that these conditions will not take place until Christ returns to earth in power and great glory? The reason is that this will be the time that these conditions will be <i class="calibre2">openly manifested to the world</i>. Then the world will see that the Thessalonians were right and their persecutors were wrong. The saints will be seen enjoying rest when they return with Christ in glory. The <b class="calibre5">destruction</b> of the Lord’s enemies at the end of the Tribulation will be a public demonstration of the doom of all who have afflicted God’s people in all ages.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It will help us to remember that Christ’s coming to reign is a time of <i class="calibre2">manifestation</i>. What has been true all along will be unveiled for all the world to see. This is not true of the Rapture.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The punishment of the wicked also includes banishment <b class="calibre5">from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power</b>. To perish without Him is to be without Him forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:10</span> His coming will be a time of glory for the Lord and of amazement for the spectators.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He will <b class="calibre5">be glorified in His saints</b>, that is, He will be honored because of what He has done in and through them. Their salvation, sanctification, and glorification will be tributes to His matchless grace and power.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He will <b class="calibre5">be admired among all those who believe</b>.<a id="calibre_link-58" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-8">4</a> Amazed onlookers will gasp as they see what He has been able to do with such unpromising human beings!</p>
      <p class="calibre3">And this will include the Thessalonians believers too, because they had received and believed the <b class="calibre5">testimony</b> of the apostles. They would share in the glory and triumph of <b class="calibre5">that Day</b>, namely, the Day of the Revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">By way of review, we might paraphrase verses 5–10 as follows: “Your patience in the midst of tribulation is very significant. In all this God is working out His righteous purposes. Your steadfast endurance of persecution shows that you are among the company of those who will share the glories of Christ’s coming reign. On the one hand, God will measure out judgment to those who now trouble you. On the other hand, He will give rest to you who are now troubled, along with us also—Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. He will judge your enemies when He comes from heaven with the angelic executors of His power in flaming fire, punishing those who are wilfully ignorant of God and those who are wilfully disobedient to the gospel. These will suffer everlasting destruction, even banishment from the Lord’s face and from the display of His power, when He returns to be glorified in all believers—including you, because you did believe the gospel message we preached to you.”</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-38" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-9">C. Paul’s Prayer for the Saints (1:11, 12)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:11</span> In the preceding verses the apostle has been describing the glorious calling of the saints. They have been called to suffer persecution, which in turn fits them for rule in the kingdom. Now he prays that their lives in the meantime will be counted <b class="calibre5">worthy of</b> such a high <b class="calibre5">calling</b>, and that God’s mighty <b class="calibre5">power</b> will enable them to obey every impulse to do good, and to accomplish every task undertaken in <b class="calibre5">faith</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">1:12</span> The result would be twofold. First, <b class="calibre5">the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</b> would <b class="calibre5">be glorified in</b> them. This means that they would give an accurate representation of Him to the world, and thus bring glory to Him. Then they, too, would be glorified <b class="calibre5">in Him</b>. Their association with Him, their Head, would bring honor to them as members of His Body.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Chapter 1 closes with the reminder that this prayer can be answered only <b class="calibre5">according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ</b>. Thus he concludes a marvelous explanation of the meaning and outcome of suffering in the believer’s life. Imagine how encouraged the Thessalonians were when they read this reassuring message!</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-39" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-16">III. CONCERNING THE DAY OF THE LORD (2:1–12)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-40" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-17">A. An Appeal for Stability (2:1, 2)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:1</span> Paul now undertakes to correct a misunderstanding that had arisen in the minds of the saints <b class="calibre5">concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</b> and the Day of the Lord. The saints were suffering such severe persecution that it was easy for them to think that they were already in the first part of the Day of the Lord, i.e., the Tribulation Period. And rumors were floating around that the <i class="calibre2">apostle himself</i> believed and taught that the Day of the Lord had arrived! So he must set the record straight.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">A crucial question arises in verse 1 concerning the small word which Paul uses: <b class="calibre5">concerning</b> (Gk. <span class="calibre2">huper</span>). The problem is whether he is beseeching the saints “about” <b class="calibre5">the coming of our</b> Lord or “by” <b class="calibre5">the coming of our Lord</b>. If the first is the meaning, then the passage seems to teach that the Rapture and the Day of the Lord are one and the same event, since the following verses clearly deal with the Day of the Lord. If the second is the meaning, then Paul is appealing to them <i class="calibre2">on the basis of</i> the prior Rapture, that they should not think they were in the Day of the Lord. The question is debatable. We agree with William Kelly when he adopts the second view:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The comfort of the Lord’s coming is employed as a motive and means for counteracting the uneasiness created by the false presentation that the day (of the Lord) was there.<a id="calibre_link-59" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-18">5</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre3">We understand Paul to be saying, “I appeal to you on the basis of the Rapture that you should not fear that you are in the Day of the Lord. The Rapture must take place first. You will be taken home to heaven at that time and will thus escape the horrors of the Day of the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The expression <b class="calibre5">the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him</b> seems to refer unmistakably to the Rapture. That is the time when we will be gathered to meet Him in the air.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:2</span> It should be clear that the Rapture is not the same as the Day of the Lord. The Thessalonians were not worried that the Lord had come; they knew that He had not. But they <i class="calibre2">were</i> worried that the Day of the Lord had begun. The intense persecution they were enduring made them think they were in the Tribulation, the first phase of the Day of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Rumors had been circulating that Paul himself had said that the Day of the Lord had arrived. Like most rumors, they were very garbled. One version intimated that Paul had received the information <b class="calibre5">by spirit</b>, that is, by a special revelation. According to another report, the news had come <b class="calibre5">by word</b>, that is, the apostle had publicly taught that the Tribulation had begun. <b class="calibre5">By letter as if from us</b> is generally understood to refer to a forged letter, purportedly from Paul, that the Day of the Lord had started. The expression <b class="calibre5">as if from us</b> probably goes with <b class="calibre5">spirit</b>, <b class="calibre5">word</b>, and <b class="calibre5">letter</b>. None of these sources was to be trusted.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">According to the KJV and NKJV (following the majority of manuscripts), the saints were afraid that <b class="calibre5">the day of Christ had come. The day of Christ</b> and similar expressions usually point forward to the Rapture and the Judgment Seat of Christ (1 Cor. 1:8; 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; Phil 1:6, 10; 2:15, 16).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">But the Thessalonians were not in fear that the Day of Christ was at hand. That would have meant release from their sufferings. Most pre-tribulationists prefer the reading in the RV: “the day of the Lord is now present.”<a id="calibre_link-60" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-19">6</a> Paul’s readers were afraid that the Day of God’s <i class="calibre2">wrath</i> had begun.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-41" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-20">B. The Man of Sin (2:3–12)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:3</span> Now the apostle explains why they could not be in <b class="calibre5">that Day</b>. Certain events must take place first. After the Rapture, these events will begin to happen.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">First of all there will be <b class="calibre5">the falling away</b>, or the apostasy.<a id="calibre_link-61" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-21">7</a> What does this mean? We can only surmise that it refers to a wholesale abandonment of Christianity, a positive rejection of the Christian faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Then a great world figure will arise. As to his character, he is <b class="calibre5">the man of sin</b> or lawlessness,<a id="calibre_link-62" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-22">8</a> that is, the very embodiment of sin and rebellion. As to his destiny, he is <b class="calibre5">the son of perdition</b>; he is doomed to eternal judgment.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Scriptures contain many descriptions of important personages who will arise during the Tribulation, and it is difficult to know when different names apply to the same person. Some commentators believe that the man of sin will be a Jewish Antichrist. Others teach that he will be the Gentile head of the revived Roman Empire. Here are the names of some of the great rulers of the end times:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">… the man of sin and son of perdition (2 Thess. 2:3)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the Antichrist (1 Jn. 2:18)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the little horn (Dan. 7:8, 24b–26)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the king of fierce features (Dan. 8:23–25)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the prince who is to come (Dan. 9:26)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the willful king (Dan. 11:36)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the worthless shepherd (Zech. 11:17)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the beast out of the sea (Rev. 13:1–10)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the beast out of the earth (Rev. 13:11–17)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns (Rev. 17:4, 8–14)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the king of the North (Dan. 11:6)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the king of the South (Dan. 11:40)</li>
        <li class="ul">… the false prophet (Rev. 19:20; 20:10)</li>
        <li class="ul">… Gog, of the land of Magog (Ezek. 38:2—39:11) [not to be confused with the Gog of Rev. 20:8 who arises <i class="calibre2">after</i> the Millennium]</li>
        <li class="ull">… the one who comes in his own name (John 5:43)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">The man of sin</b> has been given an intriguing variety of identifications down through the years. He has been equated with the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope, the Roman Empire, the final form of apostate Christendom, Judas reincarnated, Nero reincarnated, the Jewish State, Mohammed, Luther, Napoleon, Mussolini, and the embodiment of Satan.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:4</span> He will violently oppose every form of divine worship and will enthrone himself <b class="calibre5">in the temple of God</b> in Jerusalem. This description clearly identifies him as Antichrist, the one who is <i class="calibre2">opposed to</i> Christ and who sets himself up <i class="calibre2">in the place of</i> Christ.<a id="calibre_link-63" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-23">9</a></p>
      <p class="calibre3">Daniel 9:27 and Matthew 24:15 show that this blasphemous action of the Antichrist takes place in the middle of the Tribulation Period. Those who refuse to worship him will be persecuted and many will be martyred.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:5</span> Paul used to tell the Thessalonians <b class="calibre5">these things</b> when he <b class="calibre5">was still with</b> them. However, with contradictory teaching being given to them which seemed to accurately describe the fierce persecutions they were then enduring, they had forgotten what the apostle had said. We all forget too easily and need to be constantly reminded of the great truths of the faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:6</span> They knew <b class="calibre5">what</b> was <b class="calibre5">restraining</b> the full and open manifestation of the man of sin, and what would continue to restrain him until the appointed time.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">This brings us to the third great unanswered question in this chapter. The first is, “What is the apostasy?” The second is, “Who is the man of sin?” The third is, “What or who is the restrainer?”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">In the first part of verse 6, the restrainer is described in an impersonal way … <b class="calibre5">what is restraining</b>. But then in verse 7 it is a person—He who now restrains.<a id="calibre_link-64" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-24">10</a> E. W. Rogers puts it clearly:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">It is Something and Someone who wittingly, purposefully, and designedly holds it in check <i class="calibre2">with the view</i> to ensuring that the Man of Lawlessness is revealed in his own proper time.<a id="calibre_link-65" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-25">11</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre3">Seven of the more common views as to the identity of the restrainer are: (1) the Roman Empire, (2) the Jewish State, (3) Satan, (4) the principle of law and order as found in human government, (5) God, (6) the Holy Spirit, and (7) the true church as indwelt by the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Holy Spirit indwelling the church and the individual believer seems to fit the description of the restrainer more completely and accurately than any of the others. Just as the restrainer is spoken of as Something and Someone in this chapter, so the Spirit is spoken of in John 14:26, 15:26, 16:8, 13, 14 as both neuter (the Holy Spirit) and masculine (He).<a id="calibre_link-66" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-26">12</a> As early as Genesis 6:3, the Holy Spirit is spoken of in connection with the restraint of evil. Then later He is seen in this same role in Isaiah 59:19b, John 16:7–11, and 1 John 4:4.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It is by the indwelling Spirit that believers are the salt of the earth (Matt. 5:13) and the light of the world (Matt. 5:14). Salt is a preservative, but it also hinders the spread of corruption. Light dispels darkness, the sphere in which men love to perform their evil deeds (John 3:19). When the Holy Spirit leaves the world as the permanent Indweller of the church (1 Cor. 3:16) and of individual believers (1 Cor. 6:19), the restraint of lawlessness will be gone.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:7</span> Even when Paul wrote, <b class="calibre5">the mystery of lawlessness</b> was <b class="calibre5">already at work</b>. By this we understand that a tremendous spirit of disobedience to God was already stirring beneath the surface. It was at work in <b class="calibre5">mystery</b> form—not that it was mysterious but rather that it was not yet fully manifested. It was still in germ form.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">What has hindered the full display of this spirit? We believe that the presence of the Holy Spirit indwelling the church and indwelling every believer has been the restraining power. He will continue to exercise this function <b class="calibre5">until He is taken out of the way</b>, that is, at the Rapture.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">But here an objection is raised. How can the Holy Spirit be removed from the world? As one of the Persons of the Godhead, isn’t He omnipresent, that is, everywhere at all times? How then can He leave the world?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Of course, the Holy Spirit is omnipresent. He is always in all places at one and the same time. And yet there was a distinct sense in which He <i class="calibre2">came</i> to the earth on the Day of Pentecost. Jesus had repeatedly promised that He and the Father would send the Spirit (John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7). How then did the Spirit come? He came as the permanent Indweller of the church and of every believer. Until Pentecost the Spirit had been <i class="calibre2">with</i> believers, but since Pentecost He has dwelt <i class="calibre2">in</i> them (John 14:17). Until Pentecost the Spirit was known to depart from believers—hence David’s prayer, “Do not take your Holy Spirit from me” (Ps. 51:11b). After Pentecost the Spirit remains forever in believers of the Church Age (John 14:16).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Holy Spirit will, we believe, <i class="calibre2">leave</i> the world in the same sense in which He <i class="calibre2">came</i> at Pentecost—that is, as the abiding Indweller of the church and of each believer. He will still be in the world, convicting people of sin and leading them to saving faith in Christ. His removal at the Rapture does not mean that no one will be saved during the Tribulation. Of course they will. But these people will not be members of the church, but rather the subjects of Christ’s glorious kingdom.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:8</span> After the church has been Raptured to heaven, <b class="calibre5">the lawless one will be revealed</b> to the world. In this verse, the apostle skips over the career of the Antichrist and describes his ultimate doom. It almost sounds as if he will be destroyed as soon as he is revealed. But that of course is not so. He is allowed to conduct the reign of terror described in verses 9–12 before he is brought down at Christ’s coming to reign.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">If we are right in believing that the man of sin is revealed after the Rapture and that he continues until Christ’s Revelation, then his mad career lasts approximately seven years—the length of the Tribulation Period.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The <b class="calibre5">Lord</b> Jesus <b class="calibre5">will consume</b> him <b class="calibre5">with the breath of His mouth</b> (cf. Isa. 11:4; Rev. 19:15), and will bring him to nothing by the manifestation <b class="calibre5">of His coming</b>. A word from Christ and the bright shining (Gk. <span class="calibre2">epiphaneia</span>) of His appearing (<span class="calibre2">parousia</span>) are all that are necessary to end the regime of this raging impostor.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The manifestation of Christ’s coming, as has already been explained, is when He returns to the earth to take the throne and reign for one thousand years.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:9</span> <b class="calibre5">The coming of the lawless one is</b> in accordance with <b class="calibre5">the working of Satan</b>. His career resembles that <b class="calibre5">of Satan</b> because he is energized by Satan. He will display all kinds of miracles and <b class="calibre5">signs and lying wonders</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Here it is important to note that not all miracles are of God. The devil and his agents can perform miracles. The man of lawlessness will also perform them (Rev. 13:13–15).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">A miracle indicates <i class="calibre2">supernatural</i> power but not necessarily <i class="calibre2">divine</i> power. The miracles of our Lord proved Him to be the promised Messiah, not simply because they were supernatural, but because they fulfilled prophecy and were of such a moral nature that Satan could not have done them without harming his own cause.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:10</span> The Antichrist will unscrupulously use every form of wickedness to deceive the perishing people—those who heard the gospel during the Age of Grace but who had no <b class="calibre5">love</b> for <b class="calibre5">the truth</b>. If they had believed, they would have been <b class="calibre5">saved</b>. But now they are deceived by the miracles of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:11</span> God actually will <b class="calibre5">send them</b> a working of error that <b class="calibre5">they should believe the lie</b>. <b class="calibre5">The lie</b>, of course, is the Antichrist’s claim to be God. These people refused to receive the Lord Jesus as God manifest in the flesh. When He was on earth, He warned men, “I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me: if another comes in his own name, him you will receive” (John 5:43). So now they receive the man of sin who comes in his own name and demands worship as God. “Light rejected is light denied.” If a person sets up an idol in his heart, God will answer him according to his idol (Ezek. 14:4).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Antichrist will probably be Jewish (Ezek. 28:9, 10; Dan. 11:37, 38). Jews would not be deceived by one posing as the Messiah unless he claimed to be descended from the tribe of Judah and the family of David.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:12</span> From this passage it seems that those who hear the gospel in this Age of Grace but who do not trust Christ will not have another opportunity to be saved after the Rapture. If men do not believe the Lord Jesus now, they will believe the Antichrist then. It says here that they <b class="calibre5">all</b> will be judged because of their unbelief and their love of evil. This is reminiscent of Luke 14:24, “For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste my supper.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3">We know that many people will be saved during the Tribulation Period. One hundred and forty-four thousand Jews, for instance, will be saved and will be God’s messengers in preaching the gospel of the kingdom throughout the world. Through their ministry many others will be saved. But it seems that those who will be saved are those who never heard the gospel clearly presented during this present age and who never deliberately refused the Savior.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-42" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-50">IV. THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER (2:13–17)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-43" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-51">A. Paul’s Thanks That the Saints Would Escape Judgment (2:13, 14)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:13</span> In the first twelve verses, Paul described the doom of the Antichrist and his followers. Now he turns to the Thessalonian Christians and thinks of their calling and destiny by way of contrast. As he does so, he expresses thanks to God for these <b class="calibre5">brethren beloved by the Lord</b>, and proceeds to give a summary of their salvation—past, present, and future.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">God … chose you</b>. The Bible clearly teaches that <b class="calibre5">God</b> chooses men to salvation, but it never teaches that He chooses some to be damned. Men are lost through their own deliberate choice. Apart from God’s intervention, all would be lost. Does God have the right to choose some to be saved? Basically His desire is for all to be saved (1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Pet. 3:9). However, the Bible does not teach “Universalism,” the theory that all will eventually be saved.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">From the beginning</b>. This has two possible readings. First, it may mean that God’s choice was made before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). Second, the expression may also be read “as first fruits,” indicating that the Thessalonians, saved so early in the Christian dispensation, were chosen by God to be among the first of a great harvest of redeemed souls.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">For salvation</b>. This should be contrasted with the preceding verses. Unbelievers are doomed by their unbelief to eternal destruction, whereas believers are chosen <b class="calibre5">for salvation</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">Through sanctification by the Spirit</b>. Here we have the Holy Spirit’s pre-conversion work. He sets individuals apart to God from the world, convicts them of sin, and points them to Christ. Someone has well said, “If it had not been for Christ, there would have been no <i class="calibre2">feast</i>; if it had not been for the Holy Spirit, there would have been no <i class="calibre2">guests</i>!”</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">And belief in the truth</b>. First you have God’s part in salvation; now you have man’s. Both are necessary. Some people can see only God’s election, and they imply that man can do nothing about it. Others overemphasize man’s part, and neglect God’s sovereign choice. The truth lies in both extremes. Election and human responsibility are <i class="calibre2">both</i> Bible doctrines, and it is best to believe and teach both, even if we can’t understand how both can be true.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:14</span> <b class="calibre5">To which He called you by our gospel</b>. God <i class="calibre2">chose</i> us to salvation in eternity. <b class="calibre5">He called</b> us to it in time. The call refers to the moment when a person believes the truth. <b class="calibre5">Our gospel</b> does not mean that there are other genuine gospels. There is only one gospel, but there are many different preachers of it, and many different audiences. Paul is referring to the <b class="calibre5">gospel</b> of God which was preached by him.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">For the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. Here the apostle peers into the future and sees the ultimate outcome of salvation—to be with Christ and be like Him forever. J. N. Darby captures the thought in his beautiful hymn:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">And is it so—I shall be like Thy Son?</p>
        <p class="sl">Is this the grace which He for me has won?</p>
        <p class="sl">Father of glory, thought beyond all thought!</p>
        <p class="sll">In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre3">Thus in verses 13 and 14 we have “a system of theology in miniature,” a marvelous summary of the scope of God’s purposes with His believing people. He has shown us that salvation “originates in a divine choice, is wrought out by divine power, is made effective through a divine message, and will be perfected in divine glory.”</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-44" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-52">B. Paul’s Prayer that the Saints Would Be Comforted and Established (2:15–17)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:15</span> In view of their superlative calling, the saints are exhorted to <b class="calibre5">stand fast and hold the traditions which</b> they <b class="calibre5">were taught</b>, either by the apostles’ words or by their Letters. The important thing to notice here is that the only <b class="calibre5">traditions</b> which are reliable and authoritative are the inspired utterances of the apostles. Jesus condemned the scribes and Pharisees for nullifying the commandments of God by <i class="calibre2">their</i> traditions (Matt. 15:6). And Paul warned the Colossians against <i class="calibre2">the traditions of men</i> (Col. 2:8). <b class="calibre5">The traditions</b> we should hold are the great truths which have been handed over to us in the sacred Scriptures.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">This verse is sometimes used to justify the traditions of churches or of religious leaders. But any traditions which are contrary to the word of God are worthless and dangerous. If mere human traditions are accepted as equal with the Bible, who is to decide which traditions are right and which are wrong?</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:16</span> Having told out his message to the saints, the apostle now prays it in. He commonly follows his teaching with prayer (1 Thess. 5:23, 24; 2 Thess. 3:16). The prayer is addressed to <b class="calibre5">our Lord Jesus Christ Himself, and our God and Father</b>. We are accustomed to Paul’s mentioning both divine Persons in the same breath, but it is unusual for him to mention the Son first. He is, of course, emphasizing their essential unity and complete equality. In the Greek, the plural subject (<b class="calibre5">Christ</b> and <b class="calibre5">God</b>) is followed by four singular verb forms (loved, gave, comfort, establish). What is this but a further indication of the unity of nature of the Son and Father in the Godhead?</p>
      <p class="calibre3">God’s past provision is introduced as an encouragement to trust Him for future courage and strength. He <b class="calibre5">loved us and</b> gave us <b class="calibre5">everlasting consolation and good hope by grace</b>. Doubtless this looks back to the greatest exhibition of God’s love—the gift of His Son for us. Because we know that He settled the sin question at Calvary, we have eternal comfort now and the <b class="calibre5">hope</b> of a glorious future—and it is all through His marvelous <b class="calibre5">grace</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">2:17</span> The prayer itself is that God will <b class="calibre5">comfort</b> their <b class="calibre5">hearts and establish</b> them <b class="calibre5">in every good word and work</b>. Not just encouragement in the midst of distress, but strength to move forward in the battle. The word “retreat” wasn’t in the apostle’s vocabulary, and it shouldn’t be in ours either.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">Don’t miss the expression <b class="calibre5">every good word and work</b>. Truth on our lips is not enough; it must be worked out in our life. So in our lives there should be the order of teaching and doing, doctrine and duty, preaching and practice.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-45" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-28">V. PRACTICAL EXHORTATIONS (3:1–15)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-46" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-29">A. For Mutual Prayer (3:1–5)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:1</span> Paul felt the need for the prayers of the saints. This chapter opens with his request for prayer in three areas: (1) for the dissemination of the message; (2) for the triumph of the message; (3) for the preservation of the messengers.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He desires <b class="calibre5">that the word of the Lord may run swiftly</b>—a graphic picture of the gospel sprinting from place to place in spite of obstacles (see Ps. 147:15).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">He also desires that the word will produce the same marvelous spiritual and moral revolutions elsewhere that it did in Thessalonica.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:2</span> The third request is that the apostle and his co-workers might <b class="calibre5">be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men</b>. He seems to be referring to some specific opposition, probably from Jews in Corinth (Acts 18:1–18). The choice of the word <b class="calibre5">unreasonable</b> was appropriate; there is nothing more irrational than people’s opposition to the gospel and its messengers. It is something that baffles explanation. They may talk reasonably about politics, science, or a host of other subjects, but when it comes to the gospel, they lose all sense of reason.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:3</span> Don’t miss the beauty of the contrast between verse 2: “not all have faith,” and verse 3: <b class="calibre5">But the Lord is faithful</b>. This teaches us to look away from faithless men to our never-failing God. He is <b class="calibre5">faithful</b> to confirm us to the end (1 Cor. 1:9). He is <b class="calibre5">faithful</b> to deliver us out of temptation (1 Cor. 10:13). He is <b class="calibre5">faithful</b> and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). And here He is <b class="calibre5">faithful</b> to <b class="calibre5">establish</b> and to <b class="calibre5">guard</b> us <b class="calibre5">from the evil one</b> (i.e., Satan).</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:4</span> Not all have faith … the Lord is faithful … <b class="calibre5">we have confidence</b> [faith] <b class="calibre5">in the Lord concerning you</b>. As Denney has remarked, “In the Lord you may depend on those who in themselves are weak, unstable, willful, foolish.” Now Paul reminds the saints of their responsibility to <b class="calibre5">do the things</b> he commands them. Here again we have the wonderful and curious mingling of the divine and the human: God will keep you; now you keep the commandments. It is the same thought in 1 Peter 1:5: “Kept by the power of God” [His part], “through faith” [our part]. We also see it in Philippians 2:12, 13: “Work out your own salvation [our part], … for it is God who works in you [His part].”</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:5</span> In times of persecution it is easy to develop bitter thoughts toward others and to give up because of the duration and intensity of the suffering. It is for this reason that the apostle prays that the Thessalonians will love as <b class="calibre5">God</b> loves, and will be steadfast as <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> is steadfast.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The KJV’s “the patient waiting for Christ” is translated <b class="calibre5">the patience of Christ</b> in the NKJV. In the 1611 version it would mean steadfastness while <i class="calibre2">waiting</i> for Christ’s Return. In the NKJV, it means showing the same <b class="calibre5">patience</b> or endurance which Christ showed as a Man on earth and which He still shows as Man in heaven.<a id="calibre_link-67" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-30">13</a></p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">The Lord</b> in this verse may refer to the Holy Spirit, and thus all three members of the Trinity would be mentioned, as they are in 2:13, 14.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-47" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-31">B. For Dealing with the Insubordinate (3:6–15)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:6</span> It seems clear that some of the saints at Thessalonica had stopped working for a living because they were so intently waiting for the Lord’s return. Paul does not encourage this as a spiritual attitude, but proceeds to give definite instructions as to how to deal with such brethren.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">His instructions are in the form of a command to <b class="calibre5">withdraw from every brother who walks disorderly</b>, that is one who does not keep in step with the others, but who refuses to work, and who sponges off others (see vv. 10, 11). Believers should show their disapproval of such a <b class="calibre5">brother</b> by refusing to mingle with him socially. The offense is not serious enough to warrant excommunication from the church, however.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">The tradition which</b> the Thessalonians <b class="calibre5">received from</b> Paul was one of tireless industry, hard work, and self-support.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:7</span> He did not abandon his tent-making just because he knew the Lord Jesus was coming again. He was indeed expecting Christ to come at any moment, but he was serving and working with the realization that the Lord might not come during his lifetime.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:8</span> No one could accuse him of planting himself in someone’s home and eating the food which someone else’s toil had earned. He earned his own living while he was preaching the gospel. This meant long days and weary nights, but Paul was determined that he would <b class="calibre5">not be a burden to any of</b> them.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:9</span> As a preacher of the gospel, the apostle had a right to be supported by those who were converted through his ministry (1 Cor. 9:6–14; 1 Tim. 5:18). But he preferred to forego his right in order that he might be <b class="calibre5">an example</b> of noble independence and unwearied diligence.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:10</span> The Thessalonians had already been commanded not to support shirkers. If an able-bodied Christian refused to work, <b class="calibre5">neither</b> should <b class="calibre5">he eat</b>. Does this conflict with the fact that believers should always be kind? Not at all! It is not a kindness to encourage laziness. Spurgeon says, “The truest love to those who err is not to fraternize with them in their error but to be faithful to Jesus in all things.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:11</span> Now the apostle uses a delightful play on words<a id="calibre_link-68" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-32">14</a> to bring out the inconsistency of the pseudo-spirituality of these disorderly brothers. His words have been paraphrased variously as follows:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. “Some who don’t attend to business but are busybodies.”</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. “Some that are not busy people but are busybodies.”</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. “Some that are not busy in their own business but are over-busy in other people’s business.”</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. “Minding everybody’s business but their own.”</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:12</span> All <b class="calibre5">such</b> are commanded and exhorted <b class="calibre5">through our Lord Jesus Christ</b> to <b class="calibre5">work</b> without fanfare and earn <b class="calibre5">their own</b> living. This is a good testimony and glorifies God.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:13</span> Those who have been working faithfully are encouraged to press on. It is the end of the race that counts, not the beginning; so they should <b class="calibre5">not grow weary in doing</b> the right thing.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:14</span> But what about a man who refuses to <b class="calibre5">obey</b> the apostle’s instructions? The other Christians should discipline him by refusing to have social fellowship with him. The purpose of this discipline is to shame him for his behavior and constrain him to mend his ways.</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:15</span> However, this discipline is not as strong as excommunication. Here the offender is still looked on <b class="calibre5">as a brother</b>. In excommunication, he is counted as “a heathen and a tax-collector” (Matt. 18:17).</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The discipline of a believer always has in view his restoration to the Lord and to the people of God. It should not be carried out in a spirit of bitterness or enmity, but rather in Christian courtesy and firmness. He should <b class="calibre5">not</b> be treated <b class="calibre5">as an enemy, but</b> rather <b class="calibre5">as a brother</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">It seems strange to us today that Christians in Thessalonica were so ardently looking for the Lord’s return that they abandoned their daily duties. That does not seem to be a peril to the church today! We have gone to the opposite extreme. We are so taken up with business and money-making that we have lost the freshness and thrill of the hope of His imminent coming.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-48" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">VI. BLESSING AND GREETING (3:16–18)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:16</span> This verse has been called “a peaceful close to a stormy Epistle.” In it Paul prays that the suffering saints at Thessalonica may know the <b class="calibre5">peace</b> of <b class="calibre5">the Lord of peace</b> at all times and <b class="calibre5">in every way</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre3">The Christian is not dependent on anything in this world for his serenity. It is based entirely on the Person and work of the Lord Jesus. The world cannot give it or take it away. But we must appropriate it in all the circumstances of life. “Peace is not cessation from persecution, but is the calm of heart that comes from faith in God and that is independent of circumstances.”</p>
      <p class="calibre3"><span class="calibre5">3:17, 18</span> At this point <b class="calibre5">Paul</b> apparently took the pen from the hand of his amanuensis (secretary) and wrote the closing <b class="calibre5">salutation</b>. He speaks of his greeting as being the <b class="calibre5">sign in every epistle</b> he writes. Some have understood this to mean that Paul’s own handwriting at the end of each Letter proved it to be genuinely his. Others believe that the <b class="calibre5">sign</b> is the characteristic Pauline benediction: <b class="calibre5">the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all</b> (Rom. 16:24; 1 Cor. 16:23; 2 Cor. 13:14; Gal. 6:18; Eph. 6:24; Phil. 4:23; Col. 4:18; 1 Thess. 5:28; 1 Tim. 6:21; 2 Tim. 4:22; Tit. 3:15; Phmn. 25; and, if Paul wrote Hebrews, Heb. 13:25). From these references, we see that all his Epistles end on a <b class="calibre5">grace</b> note.</p>

        <p class="sbaft">The truth of the Lord’s return appears in each chapter of 1 Thessalonians and in the first two chapters of the Second Epistle. It is the unifying theme, the golden thread throughout the pattern.</p>
        <p class="sb">But we must always remember that prophecy is not designed to intrigue our intellect or challenge our curiosity. Its purpose is to exert a transforming influence on our lives.</p>
        <p class="sb">For believers the hope of the imminent return of Christ has practical implications of vast significance.</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. It should have a purifying influence on our lives (1 Thess. 5:23; 1 Jn. 3:3).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. It should burden us to pray and work for the salvation of the lost (Gen. 19:14; Ezek. 33:6; Jude 21–23).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="3">3. It should encourage us to persevere in spite of persecution and trial (Rom. 8:18; 2 Cor. 4:17; 1 Thess. 4:13–18).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="4">4. It should make us reduce our holdings of material possessions; their value declines as His coming approaches (see Lev. 25:8–10, 14–16).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="5">5. It should constrain us to apologize to anyone we have wronged and to make restitution where necessary (Matt. 5:24; Jas. 5:16).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="6">6. It should inspire us to diligent service knowing that the night is coming when no one can work (John 9:4; 1 Thess. 1:9, 10a).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="7">7. It should keep us in the attitude of expectancy (Luke 12:36) and abiding in Him so we will not be ashamed before Him as His coming (1 Jn. 2:28).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="8">8. It should make us bold to confess Christ (Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="9">9. It should prove to be a comforting hope (John 14:1–3, 28; 1 Thess. 4:18; 2 Thess. 1:7; 2 Tim. 2:12).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="10">10. It should be an encouragement to moderation, gentleness, and sweet reasonableness (Phil. 4:5).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="11">11. It should be a motive for unity and love (1 Thess. 3:12, 13).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="12">12. It should encourage an other-worldly attitude (Col. 3:1–4).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="13">13. It should be a reminder of coming review and reward (Rom. 14:10–12; 1 Cor. 3:11–15; 2 Cor. 5:10).</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="14">14. It should be used as a powerful appeal in preaching the gospel (Acts 3:19–21; Rev. 3:3).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="sb">For those who are not believers, the truth of Christ’s return should lead them to repent of their sins and make a full commitment of their lives to him as Lord and Savior. Only those who are in Christ will go to be with Him at the Rapture. The rest will be left behind for judgment.</p>
        <p class="sb">What if it were today?</p>
        <p class="sb">Because of the importance of Christ’s coming in Thessalonians and in the Christian life, we add the following summaries:</p>
        <p class="sbah">Arguments for the Pretribulation Rapture</p>
        <p class="sbaft">1. The first argument is based on imminency. There are many Scriptures that indicate that Christians should be looking for the Lord to come at any time. We should be watching and waiting, not knowing the time of His coming. If the church has to go through the Tribulation, then we cannot be looking for Him to come at any moment. In fact, He could not come for at least seven years, since we are not in the Tribulation now, and when it comes, it will last for seven years. The pretribulation view is the only one you can hold and still believe that Christ may come at any moment.</p>
        <p class="sb">Here are some of the verses that indicate that we should be constantly looking for the Lord to come since we do not know the time of that event.</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">“Not only that, but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, <i class="calibre2">eagerly waiting</i> for the adoption, the redemption of our body” (Rom. 8:23).</p>
          <p class="sb">“For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you <i class="calibre2">proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes</i>” (1 Cor. 11:26—Written to the Corinthians, this implied that the Lord might come in their lifetime.)</p>
          <p class="sb">“For in this we groan, <i class="calibre2">earnestly desiring</i> to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven” (2 Cor. 5:2—Believers will be clothed with their glorified bodies at the Rapture.)</p>
          <p class="sb">“For we through the Spirit <i class="calibre2">eagerly wait</i> for the hope of righteousness” (Gal. 5:5—The hope of righteousness is the coming of the Lord and the glorified body which we will receive at that time.)</p>
          <p class="sb">“For our citizenship is in heaven, from which we also <i class="calibre2">eagerly wait</i> for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself” (Phil. 3:20, 21).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Let your gentleness be known to all men. <i class="calibre2">The Lord is at hand</i>” (Phil. 4:5).</p>
          <p class="sb">“For they themselves declare concerning us what manner of entry we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to <i class="calibre2">wait</i> for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come” (1 Thess. 1:9, 10).</p>
          <p class="sb">“<i class="calibre2">Looking</i> for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ” (Tit. 2:13).</p>
          <p class="sb">“So Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many. To those who eagerly <i class="calibre2">wait</i> for Him He will appear a second time, apart from sin, for salvation” (Heb. 9:28).</p>
          <p class="sb">“For yet <i class="calibre2">a little while</i>, and He who is coming will come and will not tarry” (Heb. 10:37).</p>
          <p class="sb">“<i class="calibre2">Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord</i>. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain. <i class="calibre2">You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand</i>. Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. <i class="calibre2">Behold, the Judge is standing at the door</i>!” (Jas. 5:7–9).</p>
          <p class="sb">“<i class="calibre2">But the end of all things is at hand</i>; therefore be serious and watchful in your prayers” (1 Pet. 4:7).</p>
          <p class="sb">“And <i class="calibre2">everyone who has this hope in Him</i> purifies himself, just as He is pure” (1 Jn. 3:3).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Keep yourselves in the love of God, <i class="calibre2">looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life</i>” (Jude 21—Here the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ is His return to take His blood-bought people home to heaven).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Behold, <i class="calibre2">I am coming quickly</i>! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown” (Rev. 3:11).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Behold <i class="calibre2">I am coming quickly</i>! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book” (Rev. 22:7).</p>
          <p class="sb">“And behold, <i class="calibre2">I am coming quickly</i>, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his work” (Rev. 22:12).</p>
          <p class="bql">“He who testifies to these things says, ‘<i class="calibre2">Surely I am coming quickly</i>.’ Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!” (Rev. 22:20).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">There are other texts which, while they might not refer directly to the Rapture, yet add to the general impression that the coming of Christ is imminent. Throughout its history, the believing church has held that the time of Christ’s coming is unknown and that therefore it could occur at any moment.</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf"><i class="calibre2">“Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming</i>. But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect” (Matt. 24:42–44).</p>
          <p class="sb"><i class="calibre2">“But of that day and hour no one knows</i>, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Take heed, <i class="calibre2">watch and pray; for you do not know when the time is</i>. It is like a man going to a far country, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch. <i class="calibre2">Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming—in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning</i>—lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping. <i class="calibre2">And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch</i>!” (Mark 13:32–37).</p>
          <p class="sb">“And you yourselves be like men who <i class="calibre2">wait</i> for their master, when he will return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately” (Luke 12:36).</p>
          <p class="sb">“So that you come short in no gift, <i class="calibre2">eagerly waiting</i> for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Cor. 1:7).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Christ Jesus, who is <i class="calibre2">about to judge living and dead</i>” (2 Tim. 4:1 JND).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Little children, <i class="calibre2">it is the last hour</i>; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that <i class="calibre2">it is the last hour</i>” (1 Jn. 2:18).</p>
          <p class="sb"><i class="calibre2">“Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you</i>” (Rev. 3:3b).</p>
          <p class="bql">“Behold, I am coming as a thief. <i class="calibre2">Blessed is he who watches</i>, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame” (Rev. 16:15).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">2. The second argument is based on the promise that the church will be delivered from the wrath to come. In Romans 5:9, Paul says that “we shall be saved from <i class="calibre2">wrath</i> through Him.” First Thessalonians 1:10 describes the Lord Jesus as our Deliverer from the <i class="calibre2">wrath</i> to come. And in 1 Thessalonians 5:9 we learn that God has not appointed us to <i class="calibre2">wrath</i>, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. The word “wrath” may refer to the wrath of the Tribulation Period, or it may refer to God’s eternal judgment on unbelievers. In the Thessalonian Epistles, the context favors the wrath of the Tribulation (see 1 Thess. 5:2, 3; 2 Thess. 1:6–10; 2:10–12.</p>
        <p class="sb">3. In Revelation 3:10, Christ promises to keep His people from (Gk. <i class="calibre2">ek</i>, meaning “out of”) the hour of trial, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</p>
        <p class="sb">4. The structure of the book of Revelation bears out the teaching of the pre-tribulation Rapture. In chapters 2 and 3 the church is seen on earth, but after chapter 3 it is never mentioned again as being on earth. In chapters 4 and 5 the saints are seen in heaven, wearing victor’s crowns. Then follows the Tribulation on earth in chapters 6–19. The church saints are already in heaven.</p>
        <p class="sb">5. The Tribulation Period will not begin until the man of sin has been revealed (2 Thess. 2:3). But the man of sin will not be revealed until first the restrainer is removed (2 Thess. 2:7, 8). The Holy Spirit certainly answers to the name of restrainer; He hinders or restrains the full development of evil as long as the church is in the world. He will be removed as the Indweller of the church at the time of the Rapture.</p>
        <p class="sb">In one sense the Holy Spirit always was in the world and always will be. But there was a special sense in which He came at Pentecost, i.e., as the permanent Indweller of believers and of the church. It is in that sense that He will be removed at the Rapture. This does not mean that the Spirit of God will not carry on a ministry during the Tribulation. He will still convict and convert sinners. But He will not permanently indwell them and He will not incorporate them into the church. His ministry will be somewhat comparable to what it was in the OT period.</p>
        <p class="sb">6. In 1 Thessalonians 4:18 the Rapture is spoken of as a comforting prospect. The Day of the Lord does not come as a comforter but as a thief in the night (1 Thess. 5:2). It is a time of sudden destruction (v. 3) and wrath (v. 9) from which there will be no escape (v. 3). In contrast, the Rapture is an ever-brightening hope, not an ever-frightening hope.</p>
        <p class="sb">7. There must be an interval of time between Christ’s coming for His saints and His coming with His saints. When Christ comes for His saints, <i class="calibre2">all</i> believers will be taken out of the world and will receive their <i class="calibre2">glorified bodies</i> (1 Cor. 15:51). Yet when Christ comes back to reign, there will be saved people who are still in their <i class="calibre2">natural bodies</i>, as is seen by the fact that they will be raising children (Isa. 65:20–25; Zech. 8:5). If the Rapture and the Revelation take place at the same time (the post-tribulation view), then where do these latter people come from?</p>
        <p class="sb">There is a second reason why there must be an interval of time between the Rapture and the reign. The Judgment Seat of Christ must take place in heaven following the Rapture, when the Lord will judge the faithfulness of His saints and reward them accordingly (2 Cor. 5:10). The rewards given at this time will determine the extent of rule given to individual saints during the Millennium (Luke 19:17, 19). If the Rapture and the coming to reign occurred simultaneously, there would be no time for the Judgment Seat of Christ to take place.</p>
        <p class="sb">8. The only way the Day of the Lord will overtake anyone is as a thief in the night (1 Thess. 5:2). Yet Paul distinctly states that it will not overtake believers as a thief in the night (1 Thess. 5:4). Therefore it will not overtake believers at all. Why not? Two reasons are given: (1) Believers are not children of the night but of the day (1 Thess. 5:4, 5). (2) God has not appointed believers to wrath (1 Thess. 5:9).</p>
        <p class="sb">9. At the time of the Rapture, believers go to the Father’s house (John 14:3), not straight back to the earth, as post-tribulationists affirm.</p>
        <p class="sb">10. The Tribulation is distinctly Jewish in character. It is called the time of <i class="calibre2">Jacob’s</i> trouble (Jer. 30:7). Note the Jewish references in Matthew 24: Judea (v. 16), the Sabbath (v. 20), and the holy place (v. 15). These terms have nothing to do with the church.</p>
        <p class="sb">11. Several of the OT types point to a pretribulation Rapture. We do not <i class="calibre2">build</i> doctrine on types, but these types do fit the pretribulation view.</p>
        <ul class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf">Enoch, a type of the church, was translated before the waters of God’s judgment fell, whereas Noah and his family, types of the believing Jewish remnant, were preserved through the flood.</li>
          <li class="sbnl">Lot was delivered from Sodom before the fires of judgment fell.</li>
          <li class="sbnl">Abraham’s offering of Isaac prefigures God offering His Son on Calvary. The first time Isaac is mentioned after that incident is when he went out to meet his bride and to take her back to his home. So Christ’s first appearance after His Ascension will be when He comes to take His bride home to heaven.</li>
          <li class="sbnll">Elijah was translated to heaven before judgment was meted out to the wicked Jezebel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="sb">12. The first sixty-nine weeks of Daniel’s prophecy (9:24–27) extend from the decree of Artaxerxes in 445 <span class="sm1">B.C.</span> to the crucifixion of Christ. They have nothing to do with the church. Why then should the church be found in the seventieth week, which is the Tribulation Period? (Actually the Church Age occurs in an unmentioned parenthetical period between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks.)</p>
        <p class="sbah">Arguments against the Pretribulation Rapture and in favor of a Post-tribulation Rapture.</p>
        <p class="sb">1. The promise in Revelation 3:10 is not that saints will be saved out of the Tribulation but that they will be kept through it (compare John 17:15).</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The words translated “keep you from” in this verse literally mean “keep out of.” The preposition in Greek (<span class="calibre2">ek</span>) means “out of.” So the thought is not that the church will be preserved <i class="calibre2">in</i> or <i class="calibre2">through</i> the Tribulation, but that it will be kept <i class="calibre2">out of</i> it altogether.</p>
        <p class="sb">The same words are used in John 17:15 where Jesus prays, “I do not pray that you shall take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil one.” Plummer comments, “Just as Christ is that <i class="calibre2">in</i> which his disciples live and move, so the evil one is that <i class="calibre2">out</i> of [<span class="calibre2">ek</span>] which He prays that they might be kept.” The prayer has been answered; believers have been kept <i class="calibre2">out of</i> Satan’s dominion, and translated into the kingdom of God’s dear Son.</p>
        <p class="sb">2. The Greek of Romans 5:3 says, “ … <i class="calibre2">the</i> Tribulation works patience.”</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> Paul is not saying that the only time that tribulation works patience is during <i class="calibre2">the</i> Tribulation Period. His argument clearly is that the tribulation that believers undergo in this life develops patience. Also, in Greek, as in French and Spanish, abstract nouns often have the article, hence the translation “tribulation” is correct.</p>
        <p class="sb">3. Christians have always been promised Tribulation (John 16:33). There is no reason why we shouldn’t go through it.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> No one denies that “we must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God” (Acts. 14:22). But there is a vast difference between the tribulation that is the portion of every believer and the Tribulation Period that awaits a Christ-rejecting world.</p>
        <p class="sb">4. Second Thessalonians 1:7 shows that the saints will not obtain rest until the Lord Jesus returns to earth at the end of the Tribulation.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The Thessalonians to whom this was written have already received their rest in heaven. But the doom of their persecutors and the vindication of the saints will be <i class="calibre2">manifested</i> to the world when the Lord Jesus returns in power and great glory.</p>
        <p class="sb">5. According to Acts 3:21, the heavens will hold the Lord Jesus until the times of restoration of all things, that is, the Millennium.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> These words were spoken to <i class="calibre2">the men of Israel</i> (v. 4). <i class="calibre2">As far as the nation of Israel is concerned</i>, the statement is true. It agrees with the Savior’s words to Jerusalem in Matthew 23:39, “You shall see Me no more till you say, ‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’ ” That will take place at the end of the Tribulation Period. But the church will have been Raptured to heaven seven years earlier.</p>
        <p class="sb">6. Psalm 110:1 says that Christ will sit at the right hand of God until all His enemies are destroyed. This will be at the end of the Tribulation.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> In Revelation 20:8, 9, we read of some who will be enemies of Christ at the end of the Millennium—that is 1000 years after the close of the Tribulation. The right hand of God may describe a position of honor and power as well as a geographical location.</p>
        <p class="sb">7. In Titus 2:13, the blessed hope is the same as the glorious appearing. Therefore the Rapture takes place at the same time as the Revelation. Therefore, we do not look for a pretribulation Rapture but for Christ’s coming to reign.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> This argument is based on a rule of Greek syntax called Granville Sharp’s rule which says: When two nouns connected by “and” (Gk. <span class="calibre2">kai</span>) are in the same case, and a definite article precedes the first noun but not the second, the second noun refers to the same person or thing the first noun does and is a further description of it. To give an example, Titus 2:13 says, “the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.” The words “God” and “Savior” are connected by “and”; they are in the same case (objects of preposition “of”); the definite article (part of Greek for “our”) precedes “God” but not “Savior.” Therefore, according to Granville Sharp’s rule, the word “Savior” refers to the same person as “God” and is a further description of Him. This proves, of course, that our Savior, Jesus Christ, is God.</p>
        <p class="sb">Now in the same verse, it says in the Greek, “looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing.” Thus it is claimed that, according to Granville Sharp’s rule, the blessed hope is the same as the glorious appearing, and since the glorious appearing is <i class="calibre2">generally</i> understood to be Christ’s coming to reign, the believer’s hope is not a pretribulation Rapture but Christ’s coming in glory to the earth.</p>
        <p class="sb">There are two answers to this. First of all, like all good rules, Granville Sharp’s rule has exceptions. One is in Luke 14:23 where the Greek reads, “Go out into the highways and hedges.” If the rule holds, then we must believe that highways are the same as hedges! A second exception is in Ephesians 2:20: “the foundation of the apostles and prophets.” But no careful student would say that apostles and prophets are the same.</p>
        <p class="sb">But even supposing that the blessed hope <i class="calibre2">is</i> the same as the glorious appearing, what is to prevent us from looking on the Rapture as Christ’s glorious appearing to the church whereas the Revelation is His glorious appearing to the world? The words <i class="calibre2">apokalupsis</i> (revelation) and <i class="calibre2">epiphaneia</i> (shining forth or appearing) could refer to the Rapture as well as to Christ’s coming to reign.</p>
        <p class="sb">8. Other Scriptures which show that the believer’s hope is Christ’s coming to reign are 1 Corinthians 1:7; 1 Timothy 6:14; 2 Timothy 4:8; 1 Peter 1:7, 13; 4:13.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The words “revelation” and “appearing” used in these passages apply both to Christ’s coming for His saints and to His coming with His saints. First, He reveals Himself and appears to the church, then later to the world.</p>
        <p class="sb">But even if all the verses quoted did refer to Christ’s coming to reign, it should be clear that the believer’s hope embraces all the blessings of the prophetic future. We look forward to the Rapture, Christ’s coming to reign, the Millennium, and the eternal state.</p>
        <p class="sb">9. The traditional hope of the church has not been the pretribulation Rapture. This only began in the last 160 years or so through the teaching of J. N. Darby.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The NT church was waiting for God’s Son from heaven. The saints did not know when He would come so they watched for Him at any time.</p>
        <p class="sb">Arguments directed at what any person did or did not teach are called <i class="calibre2">ad hominem</i> (to the person) and are regarded as irrelevant to an issue. The question is “What does Scripture teach?” not “What did so-and-so teach?”</p>
        <p class="sb">10. The last trumpet of 1 Corinthians 15:52 and the trumpet of God (1 Thess. 4:16) are connected with the Rapture and are the same as the seventh trumpet of Revelation 11:15. Since the seventh trumpet sounds at the end of the Tribulation when “the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdom of our Lord, and of His Christ,” the return must be post-tribulational.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> These trumpets are not all the same. The “last trumpet” is the same as the “trumpet of God.” It announces the Rapture and signals the resurrection of believers and their translation to the Father’s house. It is the “last trumpet” for the church. The seventh trumpet in Revelation 11:15 is the last in a series of judgments during the Tribulation. It is the last trumpet for unbelieving Israel and unbelieving Gentiles. The “last trumpet” of 1 Corinthians 15:52, also called the “trumpet of God” (1 Thess. 4:16), takes place before the Tribulation. The seventh trumpet takes place at the end of the Tribulation.</p>
        <p class="sb">11. The first resurrection of Revelation 20:4, 5 takes place at the end of the Tribulation, and not seven years earlier, as the pretribulationists state.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The first resurrection is not an isolated event but a series. It began with the resurrection of Christ (1 Cor. 15:23). The next stage will be the resurrection of believers at the Rapture. The third stage will be the resurrection of Tribulation saints at the time of Christ’s return to the earth (Rev. 20:4, 5). In other words, the first resurrection includes the resurrection of Christ and of all true believers, no matter when they are raised. All unbelievers will be raised at the end of the Millennium to stand before the Great White Throne (Rev. 20:11–15).</p>
        <p class="sb">12. In Matthew 13:24–30, the wheat and tares grow together until the end of the age, that is, until the end of the Tribulation.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> True, but this parable is speaking of the kingdom of heaven and not of the church. There will be true and false people in the kingdom until the end of the Tribulation.</p>
        <p class="sb">13. The Rapture couldn’t be secret because there will be a shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God (1 Thess. 4:16).</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The teaching that the Rapture will be secret is based on the fact that it will take place in the twinkling of an eye (1 Cor. 15:52). It will be all over before the world has a chance to see anything or to know what has happened.</p>
        <p class="sb">14. George Müller, Samuel Tregelles, Oswald Smith, and other noted men have held the post-tribulation view.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> The argument proves nothing. There have been great men on both sides of the question.</p>
        <p class="sb">15. Most references in the NT to Christ’s coming refer to His coming to reign.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> This does not deny the truth of the Rapture. Just because there are more references to heaven than to hell in the NT does not mean that there is no hell.</p>
        <p class="sb">16. The church will not endure the wrath of God in the Tribulation, but it will endure the wrath of the Antichrist or the wrath of Satan.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> Six times in the book of Revelation the wrath of the Tribulation Period is identified as the <i class="calibre2">wrath of God</i>:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">“Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, ‘If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of <i class="calibre2">the wrath of God</i>, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb’ ” (14:9, 10).</p>
          <p class="sb">“So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress of <i class="calibre2">the wrath of God</i>” (14:19).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them <i class="calibre2">the wrath of God</i> is complete” (15:1).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of <i class="calibre2">the wrath of God</i> who lives forever and ever” (15:7).</p>
          <p class="sb">“Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, ‘Go and pour out the bowls of <i class="calibre2">the wrath of God</i> on the earth’ ” (16:1).</p>

        <p class="sb">17. When Jesus says, “I am coming quickly” (Rev. 22:7, 12, 20), it does not mean at any moment. Rather it means that His coming will be sudden.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> It is a debated point. Even if it does mean “sudden,” there are still verses like Hebrews 10:37, “For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not tarry.”</p>
        <p class="sb">18. The restrainer in 2 Thessalonians 2:6–8 is not the Holy Spirit but the Roman government or the power of God.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> This has been discussed in the notes on that passage.</p>
        <p class="sb">19. Christ’s coming couldn’t have been imminent in the apostolic days because Peter and Paul both knew that they would die (John 21:18, 19; 2 Pet. 1:14, 15; 2 Tim. 4:6).</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> Paul sometimes spoke of himself as being alive when the Lord returns (1 Thess. 4:15) and sometimes as being among those believers who would die and be raised (Phil. 3:10, 11). That is the proper attitude for all of us. We expect the Lord to come in our lifetime, but we realize that we may die before the Rapture.</p>
        <p class="sb">Peter believed that the end of all things was at hand (1 Pet. 4:7), and he condemned those scoffers who denied the Lord’s coming by saying that “all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation” (2 Pet. 3:4).</p>
        <p class="sb">20. The Lord’s coming cannot be at any moment because the gospel must go out to all the world before He comes (Matt. 24:14).</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> This refers to <i class="calibre2">the gospel of the kingdom</i> (v. 14) which will go out to all the world during the Tribulation Period. The terms of this gospel are, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, and when Christ comes, you will enter the Millennium with Him.” It is the same way of salvation that we preach, but ours looks forward to the Rapture. In other words, we say, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved, and when Jesus comes, you will go to the Father’s house with Him.”</p>
        <p class="sb">21. Passages like Matthew 28:19, 20 and Acts 1:8 speak of the gospel going out to “all the nations” and to “the end of the earth.” This being so, it was not possible for the Lord to come during the lifetime of the apostles.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> In Colossians 1:6, 23, Paul states that “all the world” and “every creature under heaven” had heard the gospel. In Romans 10:18, the gospel is said to have gone to the ends of the world. Of course, we understand that these passages refer to the known world at that time, the countries adjacent to the Mediterranean.</p>
        <p class="sb">22. Paul’s long term missionary plans, as given in Acts 18:21; 23:11; Romans 15:22–25, 30, 31, show that he did not expect the Lord to come in the immediate future.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> Paul’s plans were made, subject to the will of God (Acts 18:21; Rom. 1:10; 1 Cor. 4:19). He worked as if the Lord would not come back in his lifetime, but waited and watched as if He would return at any time.</p>
        <p class="sb">23. Paul spoke of perilous times in the last days (1 Tim. 4:1–3; 2 Tim. 3:1–5). This presupposed a time lapse during which the Lord would not come.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> Paul also said the mystery of iniquity was already working (2 Thess. 2:7), and John said it was “the last hour” in his day (1 Jn. 2:18). These men did not see any problem here that made the hope of Christ’s imminent return impossible.</p>
        <p class="sb">24. Parables such as Matthew 25:14–30 and Luke 19:11–27 presuppose that a long period of time would elapse before the Lord returned. Therefore the early believers could not have been looking for the Lord to come at any moment.</p>
        <p class="sb"><b class="calibre5">Answer:</b> Apparently the early believers did not base their doctrine on parables because they <i class="calibre2">were</i> looking for the Rapture (1 Thess. 1:10)! But quite apart from that, the “long time” of Matthew 25:19 is too indefinite to rule out imminency. The parable in Luke teaches that the <i class="calibre2">kingdom</i> would not appear immediately (Luke 19:11), but this does not preclude an any-moment Rapture of the <i class="calibre2">church</i>.</p>

Some scholars understand the “Day of Christ” as a reference to the final period of persecution, which can only begin when the man of sin has been revealed.

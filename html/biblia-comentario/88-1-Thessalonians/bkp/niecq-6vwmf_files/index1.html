<h2 id="calibre_link-86" class="ahaft">I. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
      <p class="pf">The first book by any famous author is usually highly prized as indicating earliest emphasis and gift of communication. First Thessalonians may well be Paul’s first inspired Letter. The amazing amount of Christian teaching that the apostle was able to fit into his short stay at Thessalonica is clearly indicated by the many doctrines he discusses as already known by the Thessalonians.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Today the Rapture and Second Advent of our Lord are widely believed and looked for by evangelical Christians. This was not always so. The revival of interest in this doctrine, especially through the writings of the early Brethren in Great Britain (1825–1850) was largely based on 1 Thessalonians. Without this short Letter we would be terribly deprived in our understanding of the various aspects of Christ’s return.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-88" class="ah">II. Authorship</h2>
      <p class="paft">That 1 Thessalonians is an authentic Pauline Letter is denied by virtually no Bible scholars. The support for this is sufficient, as J. E. Frame says, “unless one is prepared to assert that Paul never lived or that no letter from him has survived.”<a id="calibre_link-7" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-1">1</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">External evidence</span> that Paul is the author is found in Polycarp, Ignatius, and Justin, as well as the Marcionite Canon and the Muratorian Canon (early lists of Christian Scriptures—one heretical and one orthodox).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Internal evidence</span> is the use of Pauline vocabulary and style, and the outlook of a tender-hearted, spiritual father. The historical allusions coincide with Acts. Both in 1:1 and 2:18 the writer calls himself Paul.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-90" class="ah">III. Date</h2>
      <p class="paft">First Thessalonians was written from Corinth during Paul’s eighteen-month stay there, not long after Timothy came to Paul (1 Thess. 3:6; 2:17). Since Gallio (Acts 18) is believed to have arrived as proconsul in the early summer of <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 51, Paul must have gone there in early 50 and written 1 Thessalonians soon after. Nearly all scholars date the book in the early 50s, and it is probably safe to date the Letter more precisely in <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 50 or 51, only twenty years after our Lord’s Ascension.</p>

<section id="calibre_link-91" type="chapter">
<h2 id="calibre_link-92" class="ah">IV. Background and Themes</h2>
      <p class="paft">It was during Paul’s Second Missionary Journey that the light of the gospel first broke in on the darkness of Thessalonica (Acts 17:1–10).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">After Paul and Silas had been released from jail in Philippi, they traveled to Thessalonica via Amphipolis and Apollonia. Thessalonica at that time was a strategic city, both commercially and politically. True to form, Paul went to the Jewish synagogue and showed from the OT that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead. He then went on to declare that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah. That lasted for three Saturdays. Some of the Jews were convinced, and took their place with Paul and Silas as Christian believers. Also, many of the Greek proselytes and quite a few of the leading women of the city were converted. Then the backlash started. Those Jews who did <b class="calibre3">not</b> believe rounded up some of the hoodlums from the marketplace, incited a riot, and besieged the house of Jason, where Paul and Silas had been staying. When they didn’t find the preachers in the house, they dragged Jason and some of the other believers before the city rulers (politarchs), accusing them of having turned the world upside down. It was an unintended compliment! Then they charged the Christians with plotting to overthrow Caesar by promoting another King named Jesus. The politarchs were troubled. They required Jason and his colleagues to post bail, probably adding strict orders for his guests to get out of town. Then Jason and the others were released.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Christian brethren in Thessalonica decided that it would be wise for the preachers to leave town, so they sent them by night to Berea.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The remarkable thing is that when Paul and Silas departed, they left behind a congregation of believers who were instructed in the doctrines of the faith and who were unmoved by the persecution they endured. It would be easy to conclude from Acts 17:2 that Paul and his companions were in Thessalonica for only three Sabbaths. However, that may have been only the duration of their teaching ministry <span class="bi">in the synagogue</span>. Paul and his team may have spent as long as three months <span class="bi">in the city</span>. The apostle’s Letters to them show that the Thessalonians had a broad acquaintance with Christian doctrine, and they could scarcely have received this in three or four weeks.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">From Berea, Paul went to Athens (Acts 17:15). There he heard that the believers in Thessalonica were being persecuted. He tried to visit them, but Satan hindered (1 Thess. 2:17, 18), so he sent Timothy to them (3:1, 2). Timothy brought back a report that was, on the whole, encouraging (3:6–8), and this prompted the apostle to write this Letter. In it, he defends his ministry against slanderous attacks; he calls for separation from the prevailing immorality of that culture; he corrects misapprehensions about those who had died in Christ; he rebukes those who had quit working in view of Christ’s coming; and he urges the saints to respect their spiritual leaders.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One of the most important themes of 1 Thessalonians is the return of the Lord Jesus. It is mentioned at least once in each of the five chapters. G. R. Harding Wood put these references together and came up with the following excellent synopsis:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">The Christian who is expecting the return of the Lord Jesus has no room for: (1) Idols in his heart (1:9, 10); (2) Slackness in his service (2:9, 19); (3) Divisions in his fellowship (3:12, 13); (4) Depression in his mind (4:13–18); or (5) Sin in his life (5:23).<a id="calibre_link-8" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-30">2</a></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-31" class="ahaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-81">I. SALUTATION (1:1)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft">The Letter opens with the names of three men who had been accused of turning the world upside down. The charge was intended as a slander; it was actually a tribute.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Paul</b> was the author of the Epistle. <b class="calibre3">Silvanus and Timothy</b> were traveling with him at the time, so he included their names. <b class="calibre3">Silvanus</b> is probably the same as the Silas who sang a duet with Paul in the prison at Philippi (Acts 16:25). <b class="calibre3">Timothy</b> is the young brother from Lystra who had joined Paul just before the trip to Thessalonica (Acts 16:1).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The letter was written <b class="calibre3">to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</b>. The word we translate as <span class="bi">church</span> was used at that time to describe any kind of an assembly, so Paul wants to make it clear that this is not a heathen assembly but one that is related to <b class="calibre3">God</b> as <b class="calibre3">Father and</b> to <b class="calibre3">Jesus Christ</b> as <b class="calibre3">Lord</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The greeting <b class="calibre3">grace … and peace</b> embraces the best blessings that anyone could enjoy this side of heaven. <b class="calibre3">Grace</b> is God’s undeserved favor in every aspect of our lives. <b class="calibre3">Peace</b> is the unruffled quietness which defies the crashing, crushing circumstances of life. <b class="calibre3">Grace</b> is the cause and <b class="calibre3">peace</b>, the effect. Paul repeats the dual divine names as the co-equal source of the blessings, this time putting the possessive personal pronoun <b class="calibre3">our</b> in front of <b class="calibre3">Father</b>.<a id="calibre_link-9" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-82">3</a></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-32" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-65">II. PAUL’S PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH THE THESSALONIANS (1:2—3:13)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-33" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-66">A. Paul’s Commendation of the Thessalonians (1:2–10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">1:2, 3</span> Whenever Paul prayed he mentioned the Thessalonians. (Are we as faithful in remembering our Christian brothers and sisters?) And it was always with <b class="calibre3">thanks</b> that he prayed for them, <b class="calibre3">remembering</b> their <b class="calibre3">work of faith</b>, their <b class="calibre3">labor of love</b>, and their <b class="calibre3">patience of hope</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Their <b class="calibre3">work of faith</b> probably refers primarily to their conversion to God. This description of <b class="calibre3">faith</b> as a <b class="calibre3">work</b> reminds us of the time some people asked Jesus, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?” Jesus answered them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent” (John 6:28, 29). In this sense, faith is an act or deed. But it is not toil by which a man earns merit or in which he can boast. In fact, it is the only work that man can perform without robbing Christ of His glory as Savior and without denying his own status as a helpless sinner. Faith is a non-meritorious work by which the creature acknowledges his Creator and the sinner acknowledges his Savior. The expression <b class="calibre3">work of faith</b> also includes the <span class="bi">life</span> of faith which follows conversion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In addition to their <b class="calibre3">work of faith</b>, Paul remembered their <b class="calibre3">labor of love</b>. This speaks of their service for God motivated by <b class="calibre3">love</b> to the Lord Jesus. Christianity is not a life to be endured for duty’s sake, but a Person to be served for love’s sake. To be His slave is perfect freedom, and “love for Him makes drudgery divine.” Compared to love, the profit motive is a cheap, tawdry inducement. Love for Christ draws forth service that the dollar could never inspire. The Thessalonians were living testimonies to this fact.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, Paul was thankful for their <b class="calibre3">patience of hope</b>. This speaks of their steadfast waiting for Jesus. They had been undergoing persecution as a result of their valiant stand for Christ. But no cracks had appeared in what Phillips calls their “sheer dogged endurance.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The place of remembrance is indicated by the phrase <b class="calibre3">in the sight of our God and Father</b>. As Paul entered the presence of God in prayer, he rehearsed the spiritual birth and growth of the saints and breathed out his thanksgiving for their faith, love, and hope.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:4</span> The apostle was assured that these saints had been chosen <b class="calibre3">by God</b> before the foundation of the world. But how did he know? Did he have some supernatural insight? No, he knew they were among the elect by the way they had received the gospel.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The doctrine of <b class="calibre3">election</b><a id="calibre_link-10" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-67">4</a> teaches that God chose certain people in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4). It does <span class="bi">not</span> teach that He chose some to be damned. If men are finally lost, it is because of their own sin and unbelief.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The same Bible that teaches election also teaches human responsibility or man’s free choice. God makes a <span class="bi">bona fide</span> offer of salvation to all people everywhere. Whoever comes to Christ will find a warm welcome.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These two doctrines, election and freedom of choice, create an irreconcilable conflict in the human mind. But the Bible teaches both and so we should believe both even if we can’t harmonize them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We do not know who the elect are, and so we should carry the gospel to all the world. Sinners should not use the doctrine of election as an excuse for not believing. If they will repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, God will save them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:5</span> By <b class="calibre3">our gospel</b> Paul does not imply a different message from that of the other apostles. The contents were the same; the difference was in the messengers. The Thessalonians had not treated the message as a mere religious lecture; they had, of course, received it in word, but not <b class="calibre3">in word only</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It was <b class="calibre3">in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance</b> that it came to them: (1) <b class="calibre3">In power</b>. The message worked in their lives with supernatural energy, producing conviction of sin, repentance, and conversion. (2) <b class="calibre3">In the Holy Spirit</b>. This power was produced by the Holy Spirit. (3) <b class="calibre3">In much assurance</b>. Paul preached with great confidence in the message. The Thessalonians accepted it with <b class="calibre3">much assurance</b> as the word of God. The result in their lives was full assurance of faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul now reminds them of his own conduct while he was with them. He not only preached the gospel, but lived a consistent life. The best sermon is a holy life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:6</span> Thus Paul could say, <b class="calibre3">“You became followers of us and of the Lord.”</b> One would have expected him to say “of the Lord and of us,” mentioning the Lord first. But here he is giving the order of their experience. Their first introduction to the Lord Jesus was in the life of the apostle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is sobering to think that people are supposed to be able to see Christ in us. We should be able to say with Paul, “Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that they received the word with <b class="calibre3">affliction</b> and <b class="calibre3">joy</b>. This is how they had imitated the Lord and the apostles. Externally there was <b class="calibre3">affliction</b>; internally there was <b class="calibre3">joy</b>. It is an unusual combination! For the man of the world, it is impossible to experience joy and affliction simultaneously; to him, sorrow is the opposite of joy. The Christian has a <b class="calibre3">joy of the Holy Spirit</b> that is independent of circumstances; to him, the opposite of joy is sin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <b class="calibre3">affliction</b> they endured was the persecution which followed their conversion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:7</span> The Thessalonians became model Christians. First of all, their example of joy in the midst of persecution was an example to believers <b class="calibre3">in Macedonia and Achaia</b>, that is, to all the Christians in Greece.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:8</span> But their testimony didn’t stop there. They became reproducing Christians. Like ripples in a pool, <b class="calibre3">the word of the Lord</b> spread out in ever-widening circles: first <b class="calibre3">in Macedonia and Achaia</b>, then <b class="calibre3">in every place</b>. Soon the news of their <b class="calibre3">faith toward God</b> became so widespread that Paul didn’t have to speak about it; the people already knew.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We are not intended to be termini of our blessings, but channels through which they can flow to others. God shines in our hearts so that the light might shine out to others (2 Cor. 4:6 JND). If we have really drunk the water of salvation, then rivers of living water will flow forth to those around us (John 7:37, 38).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:9</span> It was a matter of common conversation that when the apostle and his colleagues went to Thessalonica, they had received a royal welcome. Also it had become a matter of common knowledge that a startling transformation had taken place in the lives of many people. They had <b class="calibre3">turned to God from</b> their pagan <b class="calibre3">idols</b> and had yielded their will to God as bondslaves.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that they <b class="calibre3">turned to God from idols</b>, not from idols to God. It wasn’t that they had become fed up with their idols and then decided to give God a chance. No, they <b class="calibre3">turned to God</b> and found Him so satisfying that they dropped their idols.</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">It’s that look that melted Peter,</p>
        <p class="sl">It’s that face that Stephen saw,</p>
        <p class="sl">It’s that heart that wept with Mary,</p>
        <p class="sl">Can alone from idols draw.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre5">Ora Rowan</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Let us never lose the sense of thrill and awe that is implicit in this account. Two men go into a heathen city with the word of the Lord. They preach the gospel in the power of the Spirit. The miracle of regeneration takes place: men and women become so enraptured with the Savior that they abandon their idols. Next you have a local assembly of believers praising God, living lives of holiness, bravely enduring persecution, and winning others to Christ. Truly the Lord’s service is the prince of callings!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">1:10</span> Not only were the Thessalonians serving the living and true God (in contrast to idols which are lifeless and false), but they were waiting for the Lord Jesus. Notice the details of their expectation:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The Person—<b class="calibre3">His Son</b></li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The Place—<b class="calibre3">from heaven</b></li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. The Pledge—<b class="calibre3">whom He raised from the dead</b></li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. The Precious Name—<b class="calibre3">even Jesus</b></li>
        <li class="ull" value="5">5. The Prospect—<b class="calibre3">who delivers us from the wrath to come</b></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus we have in verses 9 and 10 the three aspects of the Thessalonians’ experience:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">Turning (compare work of faith, v. 3)</li>
        <li class="ul">Serving (compare labor of love, v. 3)</li>
        <li class="ull">Waiting (compare patience of hope, v. 3)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">G. R. Harding Wood<a id="calibre_link-11" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-68">5</a> analyzes them as follows:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">Following—looking to God</li>
        <li class="ul">Serving—looking on the fields</li>
        <li class="ull">Waiting—looking for Jesus</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">The Thessalonians were waiting for God’s <b class="calibre3">Son from heaven</b>. This implies the possibility of His coming during their lifetime, in fact, <span class="bi">at any moment</span> during their lifetime. The imminent return of the Lord Jesus is the Christian’s hope. It is found in many passages of the NT, of which the following are a few:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">Luke 12:36—“And you yourselves be like men who wait for their master.”</li>
        <li class="ul">Romans 8:23—“ … waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.”</li>
        <li class="ul">1 Corinthians 11:26—“For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death till He comes.”</li>

      <p class="calibre2">The Christian knows that he may be required to pass through death, but he also knows that the Lord may come at any moment and that, in that event, he will enter heaven without dying.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">No prophecy of the Scripture needs to be fulfilled before the coming of Christ for His people. It is <b class="calibre3">the next great event</b> in God’s program.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We cannot be looking for the Lord’s return at any moment if some event or period of time has to intervene. The pretribulation Rapture position is the only one that permits the believer to look for Christ’s coming today. Other views force abandonment of the imminency of His return.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The One we look for is Jesus, our Deliverer <b class="calibre3">from the wrath to come</b>. This description of the coming Savior may be understood in two ways:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. He delivers us from the eternal punishment of our sins. On the cross He endured the <b class="calibre3">wrath</b> of God against our sins.

        <li class="ul" value="2">2. But He also delivers us from the coming period of judgment when the <b class="calibre3">wrath</b> of God will be poured out on the world that has rejected His Son. This period is known as the Tribulation and the time of Jacob’s Trouble (Dan. 9:27; Matt. 24:4–28; 1 Thess. 5:1–11; 2 Thess. 2:1–12; Rev. 6:1—19:10).</li>

      <h3 id="calibre_link-34" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-69">B. Review of Paul’s Ministry, Message, and Conduct at Thessalonica (2:1–12)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">2:1</span> In the latter part of 1:5, Paul briefly alluded to his personal character and conduct while he was at Thessalonica. Now he launches into a more thorough review of his ministry, message, and lifestyle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The point is that the primary ministry of a Christian is the ministry of <span class="bi">character</span>. What we are is far more important than anything we ever say. Our unconscious influence speaks more loudly than our conscious influence. James Denney said:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">A Christian’s character is the whole capital he has for carrying on his business. In most other callings, a man may go on, no matter what his character is, provided his balance at the bank is on the right side; but a Christian who has lost his character has lost everything.<a id="calibre_link-12" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-70">6</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The missionary martyr Jim Elliot wrote in his journal:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">In spiritual work, if nowhere else, the character of the worker decides the quality of his work. Shelley and Byron may be moral free-lancers and still write good poetry. Wagner may be lecherous and still produce fine music, but it cannot be so in any work for God. Paul could refer to his own character and manner of living for proof of what he was saying to the Thessalonians. Nine times over in this first epistle he says, “You know,” referring to the Thessalonians’ firsthand observation of Paul’s private as well as public life. Paul went to Thessalonica and lived a life that more than illustrated what he preached; it went beyond illustration to convincing proof. No wonder so much work in the Kingdom is shoddy; look at the moral character of the worker.<a id="calibre_link-13" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-71">7</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Perhaps in these verses the apostle is defending himself against the false accusation of his critics. At any rate, he first reminds the Thessalonians that his ministry was successful. They themselves were living evidence that his work had been fruitful. They knew that his visit <b class="calibre3">was not in vain</b>. They themselves had been converted and a congregation had been established.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:2</span> Then, too, his ministry was courageous. The bitter opposition and outrageous treatment <b class="calibre3">at Philippi</b>, including his imprisonment there with Silas, did not daunt, discourage, or intimidate him. He pressed on to Thessalonica. There, with the courage which only God can give, he preached <b class="calibre3">the gospel</b> in the face of <b class="calibre3">much conflict</b>. A less robust person could have thought of numerous theological reasons why God was calling him to more congenial audiences. But not Paul! He preached the message fearlessly despite great opposition, a direct result of the Spirit’s filling.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:3</span> The apostle’s <b class="calibre3">exhortation</b> to believe the gospel was true in its source, pure in its motive, and dependable in its method. As to its source, it did not spring from false doctrine but from the truth of God. As to its motive, the apostle looked on the Thessalonians unselfishly, with their good in view, and not with any ulterior, impure desire. As to its method, there was no clever plot to deceive them. Apparently his jealous enemies were accusing him of heresy, lustful desire, and craftiness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:4</span> To Paul the ministry was a sacred stewardship. He was the steward, <b class="calibre3">approved by God</b>, and <b class="calibre3">the gospel</b> was the precious treasure that had been <b class="calibre3">entrusted</b> to him by God. His responsibility was to please God by the faithful proclamation of the message, no matter what man’s reaction might be. It was clear to him that he couldn’t please both God and man, so he chose to please <b class="calibre3">God, who tests our hearts</b> and then rewards accordingly.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A steward is obligated to please the one who pays him. Preachers may sometimes be tempted to hold back the full truth for fear of repercussion from those who contribute to their support. But God is the Master, and He knows when the message is watered down or suppressed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:5</span> In verses 5–12 Paul gives an account of his behavior at Thessalonica; in doing so, he has left a splendid pattern for all servants of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First of all, he never stooped to flattery or insincerity in order to achieve results. His words were honest and transparent, and his motives were free from hypocrisy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Second, he never used the work of the Lord as <b class="calibre3">a cloak</b> under which he could hide a selfish desire to get rich. His service was not a false front <b class="calibre3">for covetousness</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">To disprove any charge of flattery, he appeals to the saints. But to disprove any thought of <b class="calibre3">covetousness</b>, he appeals to <b class="calibre3">God</b>, who is the only One who can read the heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:6</span> Here we have another impressive insight into the character of this great man of God. <b class="calibre3">As apostles of Christ</b>, he and his colleagues were entitled to financial support (here called <b class="calibre3">glory</b>) from the Thessalonians. But they were determined that they would not be burdensome to them, so they worked day and night to provide for their own needs. It was a different story in Corinth. There Paul worked so as not to give his critics any ground for accusing him of preaching for money. In Thessalonica he worked because the saints were poor and persecuted, and he did not want to be an added burden to them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:7</span> Instead of lording it over God’s heritage, he was <b class="calibre3">gentle among</b> them <b class="calibre3">as a nursing mother</b> caring for <b class="calibre3">her own children</b>. Paul realized that new converts need <b class="calibre3">nursing</b>, and he carried on this ministry with all the solicitude of a devoted <b class="calibre3">mother</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:8</span> So deep was his affectionate concern for them, he was anxious to share with them rather than to receive from them. His was not a cold, perfunctory dispensing of <b class="calibre3">the gospel of God</b> but a pouring out of his very soul. He loved them, and love is heedless of cost. Like his Master, he did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life (Mark 10:45).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:9</span> A further evidence of Paul’s unselfishness is here: we see him working as a tentmaker in order to earn a living so that he could minister to the people without being <b class="calibre3">a burden to any of</b> them. While it is true that the gospel preacher is entitled to financial support from other Christians, it is commendable to see him foregoing this right, if necessary, from time to time. A true minister of Christ will continue to preach the gospel whether he receives money for it or has to work to finance himself. Notice the expressions <b class="calibre3">labor and toil</b> and <b class="calibre3">night and day</b>. The gospel didn’t cost the Thessalonians a penny, but it cost Paul plenty.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:10</span> The believers could testify to Paul’s exemplary behavior toward them; and <b class="calibre3">God also</b> was a Witness that he was devout (or holy), just (or righteous), and blameless. Holy, that is, separated to God from sin. Righteous in character and in conduct. Blameless toward God and man. If the best sermon is a holy life, Paul was a great preacher. Not like another preacher whose eloquence was greater than his conduct: when he was in the pulpit, the people wished he would never leave it, but when he was out of it, they wished he would never enter it again!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:11</span> In verse 7, he had compared himself to a nursing mother; now he changes the figure to that of a devoted <b class="calibre3">father</b>. If the former suggests tenderness and affection, the latter suggests wisdom and counsel. <b class="calibre3">As a father</b>, he <b class="calibre3">exhorted</b> them to live a holy life, he encouraged them to go on for the Lord in spite of persecutions, and he testified concerning the blessedness of obedience to the will and word of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:12</span> The goal of Paul’s ministry was that the saints might <b class="calibre3">walk worthy of God who calls</b> them <b class="calibre3">into His own kingdom and glory</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In ourselves we are unworthy of God or of a place in heaven; the only worthiness we have is found in the Lord Jesus Christ. But as sons of God, we are expected to <b class="calibre3">walk worthy</b> of the high calling. We can do this by submitting ourselves to the control of the Holy Spirit and by confessing and forsaking sin in our lives continually.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">All who are saved are subjects of God’s <b class="calibre3">own kingdom</b>. At the present time that <b class="calibre3">kingdom</b> is invisible, and the King is absent. But the moral and ethical teachings of the kingdom apply to us today. When the Lord Jesus returns to reign, the <b class="calibre3">kingdom</b> will then be set up in visible form, and we will share the <b class="calibre3">glory</b> of the King in that day.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-35" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-72">C. Review of the Thessalonians’ Response to the Gospel (2:13–16)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">2:13</span> Now the apostle picks up another theme which he had touched on in 1:5a—the Thessalonians’ response to the preaching of the gospel. When they received the message, that is, <span class="bi">heard</span> it, they did not receive (i.e., <span class="bi">accept</span> it as the word of men but as the word of God). The NKJV brings this out clearly:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs"><b class="calibre3">For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe</b>.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul is deeply thankful for their reception and acceptance of the message. This is another example of his selflessness. Most of us want others to believe what we say simply because <span class="bi">we</span> say it. But man’s word forms a shaky foundation for faith. Only God can be fully trusted, and it is only when His word is trusted that results are produced in hearts and lives. This is what happened to the Thessalonians—the word was working <b class="calibre3">effectively</b> in their lives because they believed. Walter Scott wrote:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">His Word—the Bible—is inspired, or God-breathed, in all its books and parts as originally written. It is our only authority in all things, for all circumstances, and all times. There is needed a generation who shall tremble at the Word of God. It is life’s chart; our guidance, our light, our moral safeguard. Thank God for the Sacred Volume.<a id="calibre_link-14" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-73">8</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:14</span> What results had the Bible produced in the lives of these believers? Not only had they been saved; they were enabled to stand firm in the face of severe persecution. This was good evidence of the reality of their conversion. By their steadfast endurance, they <b class="calibre3">became imitators of the</b> Christian <b class="calibre3">churches in Judea</b>. The only difference was that the Thessalonians <b class="calibre3">suffered</b> at the hands of their Gentile <b class="calibre3">countrymen</b>, whereas the believers in Judea were persecuted by <b class="calibre3">the Judeans</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:15</span> At this mention of the Judeans, Paul launches into an indictment of them as arch-opponents of the gospel. And who should know better than he? At one time he had been a ringleader of those Jews who attempted to liquidate the Christian faith. Then after his conversion he himself felt the sharp edge of the sword of their persecution.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The crowning sin of the Jews was killing <b class="calibre3">the Lord Jesus</b>. While the actual crucifixion was carried out by the Romans, it was the Jews who stirred them up to do it. This came as a climax to centuries of persecution of God’s <b class="calibre3">prophets</b> sent to the nation of Israel (Matt. 21:33–39).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the Christian era, they had already <b class="calibre3">persecuted</b> Paul and other apostles, mistakenly thinking that they were pleasing <b class="calibre3">God</b>. Their actions were displeasing to Him, and they made themselves <b class="calibre3">contrary to all men</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:16</span> Not content to reject the gospel themselves, they were determined to prevent Paul and his associates from preaching the message <b class="calibre3">to the Gentiles</b>. Nothing infuriated them more than to hear that Gentiles could <b class="calibre3">be saved</b> in the same way as Jews.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In their opposition to the will of God, they were carrying on where their fathers had left off: <b class="calibre3">always to fill up the measure of their sins</b>. It was as if they were determined to keep the cup of their guilt full at all times.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But their doom is pronounced, for <b class="calibre3">wrath has come upon them to the uttermost</b>. Paul does not specify what he means by this <b class="calibre3">wrath</b>. Perhaps it is a general statement of impending judgment as a result of a full measure of guilt. We do know that within twenty years (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 70) Jerusalem was destroyed and the surviving Jews were scattered throughout the earth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">From passages such as this, some have suggested that Paul was anti-semitic and that the NT is an anti-semitic book. The truth is that Paul had a deep love for his countrymen, the Jews, and was even willing to be cut off from Christ if it could have meant their salvation (Rom. 9:1–3). Though his ministry was primarily to the Gentiles, he never lost his burden for the evangelization of the Jews; at times this burden almost seems to have taken precedence over his primary mission.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What the apostle says here about the Judean leaders is historical fact and not personal invective. And we must remember that God moved him to write what he did. Anti-semitism is unchristian and cannot be justified under any circumstances. But it is not anti-semitic to say that the Jewish people are charged by God with the death of His Son (Acts 2:23), just as the Gentiles also are held responsible for their part (1 Cor. 2:8).</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-36" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-74">D. Explanation of Paul’s Failure to Return to Thessalonica (2:17–20)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">2:17</span> In the next four verses, the apostle explains his failure to return to Thessalonica. Perhaps his carping critics accused him of cowardice in not going back because of the opposition he had encountered there.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul first makes it clear that the separation was only physical. The expression <b class="calibre3">having been taken away from you</b> means that they were orphaned by the departure of their spiritual father. However, his affectionate interest in them had never waned. Notice the words that express the intensity of his love: <b class="calibre3">endeavored more eagerly … with great desire</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:18</span> Twice he had tried to go back to Thessalonica, but twice <b class="calibre3">Satan</b> had <b class="calibre3">hindered</b>. The exact nature of Satan’s opposition is not always known.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Neither do we know how Paul could be sure it was the devil who <b class="calibre3">hindered</b> him and not the Lord. In Acts 16:6 we read that Paul and his party were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. In the next verse, they tried to go to Bithynia but the Spirit would not permit them to go. How can we know when it is the Spirit and when it is the devil who is hindering? Perhaps one way is this: when we know that we are in the will of God, any hindrances that arise are not the Spirit’s work but the devil’s. Also, Satan can be expected to hinder whenever God is blessing. But God always overrules Satan’s opposition. In this particular case, Paul’s inability to go to Thessalonica resulted in the writing of this Letter. The Letter, in turn, has resulted in glory to God and blessing to us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:19</span> Why was the apostle so interested in going back to the Thessalonian believers? Because they were his children in the Lord. He had pointed them to Christ and felt responsible for their spiritual growth. He knew that he would have to give an account of them in a coming day. They were his <b class="calibre3">hope</b> of reward at the Judgment Seat of Christ. He wanted to be able to rejoice in them. They would be his <b class="calibre3">crown of rejoicing</b> before the <b class="calibre3">Lord Jesus Christ at His coming</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It seems obvious from this verse that Paul expected to recognize the Thessalonians in heaven. And it follows that we too will know our loved ones in heaven.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In verse 19 Paul speaks of his children in the faith as being his <b class="calibre3">crown</b>. Elsewhere in the NT we read of other crowns: the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8); the crown of life (Jas. 1:12; Rev. 2:10); the crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4)—all of them incorruptible (1 Cor. 9:25).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">2:20</span> The saints were his <b class="calibre3">glory and joy</b>. He had invested in human personality and his reward was spiritual sons and daughters who would worship the Lamb of God for all eternity.</p>

        <p class="sbt"><a class="xref" href="part0002.html#rsb37">THE COMING OF THE LORD</a></p>
        <p class="sbaft">In verse 19, we have the first use of the word <b class="calibre3">coming</b> in 1 Thessalonians with regard to the Lord’s return. Because this is the major theme of this Epistle, we are going to pause here and give an explanation of what we believe to be the scriptural teaching on the subject.</p>
        <p class="sb">There are three principal Greek words used in the NT with reference to Christ’s return:</p>
        <ul class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf"><span class="calibre5">parousia</span> (pa-roo-SEE-ah): coming and subsequent presence</li>
          <li class="sbnl"><span class="calibre5">apokalupsis</span> (apo-KAL-yoop-sis): unveiling, revelation</li>
          <li class="sbnll"><span class="calibre5">epiphaneia</span> (epi-FAHN-ee-ah): manifestation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="sb">The word most commonly used is <span class="calibre5">parousia</span>. It means a <i class="calibre5">presence</i> or a <i class="calibre5">coming alongside</i>. Vine says it denotes both an arrival and a consequent presence. When we think of the Lord’s coming, we should think of it not only as a momentary event but as a period of time.</p>
        <p class="sb">Even in English, the word <i class="calibre5">coming</i> is used in this way. For instance, “Christ’s coming to Galilee brought healing to multitudes.” Here we do not mean the day He arrived in Galilee but the whole period of time He spent in that area. So when we think of Christ’s coming, we should think of a period of time rather than an isolated event.</p>
        <p class="sb">Now if we take all the occurrences of <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> in the NT, we find that they describe a period of time with (1) a beginning, (2) a course, (3) a manifestation, and (4) a climax.</p>
        <p class="sb">1. The <i class="calibre5">beginning</i> of the <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> is the Rapture. It is described in the following passages (the word which translates <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> is italicized in each case):</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive. But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, afterward those who are Christ’s at His <i class="calibre5">coming</i> (1 Cor. 15:22, 23).</p>
          <p class="sb">But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus. For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. Therefore comfort one another with these words (1 Thess. 4:13–18).</p>
          <p class="sb">Now, brethren, concerning the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him … (2 Thess. 2:1).</p>
          <p class="sb">Therefore be patient, brethren, until the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently for it until it receives the early and latter rain. You also be patient. Establish your hearts, for the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of the Lord is at hand (James 5:7, 8).</p>
          <p class="bql">And now, little children, abide in Him, that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His <i class="calibre5">coming</i> (1 John 2:28).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">2. The <i class="calibre5">course</i> of the <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> includes the Judgment Seat of Christ when rewards will be given to believers for faithful service:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Is it not even you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His <i class="calibre5">coming</i>? (1 Thess. 2:19).</p>
          <p class="bql">Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thess. 5:23).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">Another event which should probably be included in the <i class="calibre5">course</i> of the <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> is the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. From its location in the book of Revelation, we know that it will take place prior to Christ’s glorious reign. We include it here even though the word <i class="calibre5">coming</i> is not used in connection with it.</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="bqs">And I heard, as it were, the voice of a great multitude, as the sound of many waters and as the sound of mighty thunderings, saying, “Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns! Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.” And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. Then he said to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb!’ ” (Rev. 19:6–9).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">3. The <i class="calibre5">manifestation</i> of Christ’s coming is His return to earth in power and great glory to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords. The Rapture will not be seen by the world; it takes place in a split second. But every eye will see Christ when He comes to reign. Therefore it is called the <i class="calibre5">manifestation</i> of His <i class="calibre5">parousia</i>. This is the third phase of His coming.</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your <i class="calibre5">coming</i>, and of the end of the age?” (Matt. 24:3).</p>
          <p class="sb">For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of the Son of Man be (Matt. 24:27).</p>
          <p class="sb">But as the days of Noah were, so also will the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of the Son of Man be (Matt. 24:37).</p>
          <p class="sb">And [they] did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of the Son of Man be (Matt. 24:39).</p>
          <p class="sb">So that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints (1 Thess. 3:13).</p>
          <p class="sb">And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His <i class="calibre5">coming</i> (2 Thess. 2:8).</p>
          <p class="bql">For we did not follow cunningly devised fables when we made known to you the power and <i class="calibre5">coming</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of His majesty (2 Pet. 1:16). [Here Peter is speaking about the manifestation of Christ’s <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> as it was pre-pictured on the Mount of Transfiguration.]</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">4. Finally we have the <i class="calibre5">climax</i> of the <i class="calibre5">parousia</i>. It is referred to in the following verse:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="bqs">Where is the promise of His <i class="calibre5">coming</i>? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation (2 Pet. 3:4).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">In this latter chapter we read of scoffers who will arise in the last days, denying the probability of Christ’s return. What aspect of the <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> do they mean?</p>
        <p class="sb">Are they referring to the Rapture? No. They probably know nothing about the Rapture. Are they referring to Christ’s coming to reign? No. It is apparent that they are not. The entire context indicates that they are ridiculing the final punishment of all evildoers by the Lord. They mean a last, climactic judgment of God on the earth, or what they call “the end of the world.” Their argument is that they have nothing to worry about. God hasn’t intervened in history and He won’t intervene in the future. So they feel free to continue in their evil words and deeds.</p>
        <p class="sb">Peter answers their scoffing by pointing forward to the time, <i class="calibre5">after the thousand-year reign of Christ</i>, when the heavens and the earth as we now know them will be utterly destroyed. This climax of Christ’s <i class="calibre5">parousia</i> is after the Millennium and at the inauguration of the eternal state.</p>
        <p class="sb">In addition to <i class="calibre5">parousia</i>, the other two words used in the original language of the NT to describe the coming of the Lord are <span class="calibre5">apokalupsis</span> and <span class="calibre5">epiphaneia</span>.</p>
        <p class="sb"><span class="calibre5">Apokalupsis</span> means an <i class="calibre5">unveiling</i> or a <i class="calibre5">Revelation</i>. Bible students are divided whether it <i class="calibre5">always</i> refers to the third phase of Christ’s coming—His coming to the earth in power and glory—or whether it might also refer to the Rapture when He will be revealed to the church.</p>
        <p class="sb">In the following verses it could refer either to the Rapture or to the coming back to the earth to reign over it:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">So that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the <i class="calibre5">revelation</i> of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor. 1:7).</p>
          <p class="sb">That the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the <i class="calibre5">revelation</i> of Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 1:7).</p>
          <p class="sb">Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the <i class="calibre5">revelation</i> of Jesus Christ (1 Pet. 1:13).</p>
          <p class="bql">But rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is <i class="calibre5">revealed</i>, you may also be glad with exceeding joy (1 Pet. 4:13).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">In another passage this word seems to refer quite clearly to Christ’s coming to reign:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="bqs">And to give you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus is <i class="calibre5">revealed</i> from heaven with His mighty angels (2 Thess. 1:7).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb"><i class="calibre5">Epiphaneia</i> means a <i class="calibre5">manifestation</i> or an <i class="calibre5">appearing</i>. Again, some think it refers both to Christ’s appearing for His saints and to His appearing with His saints; others say it refers only to the latter. The word is found in the following passages:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="crtf">And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the <i class="calibre5">brightness</i> (lit., <i class="calibre5">manifestation</i>) of His coming (2 Thess. 2:8).</p>
          <p class="sb">That you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ’s <i class="calibre5">appearing</i> (1 Tim. 6:14).</p>
          <p class="sb">I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His <i class="calibre5">appearing</i> and His kingdom (2 Tim. 4:1).</p>
          <p class="sb">Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His <i class="calibre5">appearing</i> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
          <p class="bql">Looking for the blessed hope and glorious <i class="calibre5">appearing</i> of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ (Tit. 2:13).</p>
        </div>
        <p class="sb">The first and third verses clearly describe the appearing of Christ to the world. The others could conceivably refer to the Rapture also. The one thing that is clear is that both the Rapture and Christ’s coming to reign are held before the believer as events for which he waits with eagerness. At the time of the Rapture, he will see the Savior and will receive his glorified body. When Christ returns to earth, the believer will appear with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). It is at this time also that the believer’s rewards will be manifested. These rewards are given out previously at the Judgment Seat of Christ, but they are seen by all when Christ comes to reign. What are the rewards? In Luke 19:17–19 there is a hint that they have to do with local rule in the Millennium. One person is made ruler over ten cities, another over five.</p>
        <p class="sb">By studying the various references to the Lord’s coming, we have seen that it refers to a period of time rather than to a single event, and that this period of time has various phases or stages. There is a beginning, a course, a manifestation, and a climax. It begins with the Rapture, includes the Judgment Seat of Christ, will be visibly displayed when Christ returns to earth, and will end when the heavens and earth as we now know them are destroyed by fire.</p>

      <h3 id="calibre_link-37" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-75">E. The Mission of Timothy to Thessalonica (3:1–10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft">The words <span class="bi">your faith</span> occur five times in chapter 3 (vv. 2, 5, 6, 7, 10) and are a key to understanding the passage. The Thessalonians were passing through severe persecution, and Paul was anxious to know how their faith was standing up to the test. Thus the chapter is a lesson on the importance of follow-up work. It is not enough to lead sinners to the Savior. They must be helped to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:1</span> In chapter 3 we continue to hear the heartbeat of Paul as he expresses his undying interest in the saints at Thessalonica. While he was <b class="calibre3">in Athens</b> he developed an intolerable craving to know how his converts were getting on. Satan had hindered his personal return. Finally he could not stand inaction any longer; he decided to send Timothy to the Thessalonians, while he remained <b class="calibre3">in Athens alone</b>. (The <span class="bi">we</span> is editorial.) There is a certain sadness to think of him there <b class="calibre3">alone</b>. The sights of a great city held no attraction for him; he was burdened with the care of the churches.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:2</span> Notice the “degrees” after Timothy’s name: <b class="calibre3">our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ</b>. The word <b class="calibre3">minister</b><a id="calibre_link-15" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-76">9</a> here and elsewhere in the NT simply means <span class="bi">servant</span>. The idea of a separate class known as clergymen originated in later years.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What a privilege it was for Timothy to serve his apprenticeship under the beloved brother Paul! Now that he has proved himself, he is sent on a mission to Thessalonica alone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The purpose of the trip was <b class="calibre3">to establish</b> the saints <b class="calibre3">and encourage</b> them <b class="calibre3">concerning</b> their <b class="calibre3">faith</b>. They had been persecuted because of their confession of Christ. This was a critical time for the young converts; Satan was probably dropping subtle suggestions that maybe they were wrong after all in becoming Christians!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It would be interesting to hear Timothy as he taught them to expect opposition, to bear it bravely, and to rejoice in it. They needed encouragement not to buckle under the pressure of opposition.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:3</span> In the heat of persecution, it would be easy for the Thessalonians to think it strange that they should suffer so severely, and to wonder if God was displeased with them. Timothy reminded them that it wasn’t strange at all: this is normal for Christians, so they shouldn’t <b class="calibre3">be shaken</b> or lose heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:4</span> Paul reminds them that even when he was in Thessalonica, he used to tell them that Christians were appointed to afflictions. His prediction came true in their own lives. How well they knew it!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Trials form a necessary discipline in our lives:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. They prove the reality of our faith, and weed out those who are mere professors (1 Pet. 1:7).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. They enable us to comfort and encourage others who are going through trials (2 Cor. 1:4).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. They develop certain graces, such as endurance, in our character (Rom. 5:3).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. They make us more zealous in spreading the gospel (Acts 4:29; 5:27–29; 8:3, 4).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="5">5. They help to remove the dross from our lives (Job 23:10).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:5</span> The apostle repeats the substance of verses 1 and 2: <b class="calibre3">when</b> further delay proved unendurable for him, he <b class="calibre3">sent</b> Timothy to find out how the Christians there were weathering the storm. His great anxiety was that the devil might have tricked them into giving up their aggressive Christian testimony in exchange for relaxation of the persecution. It is the ever-present temptation to swap loyalty to Christ for personal comfort, to by-pass the cross in pursuit of a crown. Who of us does not have to pray, “Forgive me, Lord, for so often finding ways to avoid the pain and sacrifice of discipleship. Strengthen me today to walk with You no matter what the cost.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If Satan had induced the saints to recant, then Paul felt his labor there would have been for nothing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:6</span> <b class="calibre3">Timothy</b> came back to Corinth <b class="calibre3">from</b> the Thessalonians with <b class="calibre3">good news</b>. First of all, he reassured Paul concerning their <b class="calibre3">faith and love</b>. They were not only standing true to the teachings of the Christian <b class="calibre3">faith</b>, but they were also manifesting the distinctive virtue of <b class="calibre3">love</b>. This is ever the test of reality—not just an orthodox acceptance of the Christian creed, but “faith working through love” (Gal. 5:6). Not just your “faith in the Lord Jesus” but also “your love for all the saints” (Eph. 1:15).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Was it significant that Timothy mentioned their <b class="calibre3">faith and love</b>, but omitted any reference to their hope? Had the devil shaken their confidence in the return of Christ? Possibly. As William Lincoln said, “The devil hates that doctrine because he knows the power of it in our lives.” If their hope was defective, Paul certainly seeks to repair it in this Epistle of hope.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Timothy also reported that the Thessalonians had kind memories of the apostle and his friends, and that they were as anxious for a reunion as Paul, Silas, and Timothy were.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:7</span> This news was like cold water to Paul’s thirsty soul (Prov. 25:25). In all his distress and affliction, he was greatly encouraged <b class="calibre3">by</b> their <b class="calibre3">faith</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:8</span> He exclaims, <b class="calibre3">“For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.”</b> The suspense of not knowing had been a living death to him. Now life quickly returned when he heard that all was well. What a commentary this is on the unselfish devotion of this great man of God!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:9</span> Words failed to express adequately <b class="calibre3">to God</b> the <b class="calibre3">thanks</b> which filled Paul’s heart. His cup of <b class="calibre3">joy</b> was overflowing every time he remembered them <b class="calibre3">before</b> his <b class="calibre3">God</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:10</span> Paul’s prayer life was habitual, not spasmodic: <b class="calibre3">night and day</b>. It was intensely fervent: <b class="calibre3">praying exceedingly</b>. It was specific: <b class="calibre3">that we may see your face</b>. And it was altruistic: <b class="calibre3">that we may … perfect what is lacking in your faith</b>.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-38" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-77">F. Paul’s Specific Prayer (3:11–13)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">3:11</span> The chapter closes with Paul’s prayer for a return trip to them, and for the development of even greater love in them. The request is addressed to <b class="calibre3">our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. Then this plural subject is followed by a singular verb. This usage indicates the deity of Christ and the unity of the Godhead.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:12</span> The Thessalonians had actually been commendable in manifesting true Christian love, but there is always room for development. And so he prays for a deeper measure: <b class="calibre3">may the Lord make you increase and abound in love</b>. Their <b class="calibre3">love</b> should embrace their fellow believers and all men, including their enemies. Its model or pattern should be the love of the apostles: <b class="calibre3">just as we do to you</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">3:13</span> The result of love in this life is blamelessness in the next. If we love one another and all mankind, we will stand <b class="calibre3">blameless in holiness before our God</b> when <b class="calibre3">Christ</b> comes <b class="calibre3">with all His saints</b>, for love is the fulfilling of the law (Rom. 13:8; Jas. 2:8).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Someone has paraphrased the prayer as follows: “The Lord enable you more and more to spend your lives in the interests of others, in order that He may so establish you in Christian character now, that you might be vindicated from every charge that might possibly be brought against you ….”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In chapter 2 we saw that the coming of Christ has several stages or phases: a beginning, a course, a manifestation, and a climax. It is the third phase that is referred to in verse 13: <b class="calibre3">the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints</b>. The Judgment Seat of Christ will have already taken place in heaven. The awards will already have been made. But these awards will be manifested to all when the Savior returns to earth as King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">Saints</b> here probably means those believers who have been caught up to heaven at the time of the Rapture (1 Thess. 4:14). Some think that it means angels, but Vincent says it refers to <b class="calibre3">the holy and glorified people of God</b>. He points out that angels have nothing to do with anything in this Epistle, but that glorified believers are closely connected with the subject that was troubling the Thessalonians. He adds, “This does not exclude the attendance of angels on the Lord’s coming, but when Paul speaks of such attendance, he says <b class="calibre3">with the angels of his power</b>, as in 2 Thessalonians 1:7.”<a id="calibre_link-16" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-78">10</a></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-39" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-48">III. PRACTICAL EXHORTATIONS (4:1—5:22)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-40" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-49">A. The Sanctification That Fulfills God’s Will (4:1–8)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">4:1</span> The word <b class="calibre3">finally</b> doesn’t mean that Paul is about to close the Letter. It often indicates a change of subject, such as a shift to practical exhortations.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Three prominent words at the close of chapter 3 were <span class="bi">holiness</span>, <span class="bi">love</span>, and <span class="bi">coming</span>. These are three of the principal subjects of chapter 4: (1) Holiness (vv. 1–8), (2) Love (vv. 9, 10), and (3) Coming (vv. 13–18). The other main theme is industriousness (vv. 11, 12).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Chapter 4 opens with a plea to walk in holiness and thus to please God, and closes with the taking up of the saints. Paul was probably thinking of Enoch when he wrote this. Notice the similarity: (1) Enoch walked with God (Gen. 5:24a); (2) Enoch pleased God (Heb. 11:5b); and (3) Enoch was taken up (Gen. 5:24b; Heb. 11:5a). The apostle commends the believers for their practical holiness, but urges them to advance to new levels of accomplishment. Holiness is a process, not an achievement.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:2</span> While he was with them, Paul repeatedly charged them, with the authority of <b class="calibre3">the Lord Jesus</b>, that they should please God by lives of practical holiness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:3</span> <b class="calibre3">The will of God</b> for His people <b class="calibre3">is</b> their <b class="calibre3">sanctification</b>. To sanctify means to set apart for divine use. In one sense, all believers have been set apart from the world to the service of the Lord; this is known as positional sanctification, and it is perfect and complete (1 Cor. 1:2; Heb. 10:10). However, in another sense, believers should sanctify themselves, that is, they should separate themselves from all forms of sin; this is known as practical or progressive sanctification. It is a process that will continue until the believer’s death or the Lord’s return. It is this latter use of the word that is found in verse 3. (See the discussion of sanctification under 5:23 below.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The specific sin against which Paul warns is unlawful sexual activity, and in this section is probably the same as adultery. It is one of the principal sins of the heathen world. The admonition, <b class="calibre3">that you should abstain from sexual immorality</b>, is needed today as much as in the first century of the church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:4</span> The Christian program is for every one <b class="calibre3">to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor</b>. The word <b class="calibre3">vessel</b> in this verse may mean a wife or it may mean the man’s own body. It is used of a wife in 1 Peter 3:7 and of the body in 2 Corinthians 4:7.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The RSV understands it to mean a wife: “that each one of you know how to take a wife for himself in holiness and honor.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The NEB adopts the view that the body is meant: “every one of you must learn to gain mastery over his body, to hallow and honor it.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If we allow the context to decide, then <b class="calibre3">vessel</b> means the man’s wife. The teaching is that each man should treat his wife honorably and decently, never stooping to any form of marital unfaithfulness. This reinforces monogamy as God’s will for mankind (see also 1 Cor. 7:2).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:5</span> The Christian view of marriage is in sharp contrast to that of the ungodly. As one commentator said, “When Jesus laid His hands on the woman in Luke 13:13, she was made straight. When pagan man touches a woman, she is made crooked.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">The Gentiles</b> think of sex as a means of gratifying the <b class="calibre3">passion of lust</b>. To them chastity is a weakness, and marriage a means of making sin legal. By their filthy conversation and their obscene writings on public walls, they glory in their shame.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:6</span> Sexual immorality is a sin against God’s Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19); it is a sin against one’s own body (1 Cor. 6:18); but it is also a sin against other persons. So Paul adds: <b class="calibre3">that no one should take advantage of and defraud his brother in this matter</b>. In other words, a Christian man must not go beyond the bounds of marriage and <b class="calibre3">defraud</b> a <b class="calibre3">brother</b> by stealing the affections of the brother’s wife. Though these offenses are not generally punished in criminal courts today, <b class="calibre3">the Lord is the avenger of all such</b>. Sexual sins bring on a terrible harvest of physical and mental disorders in this life, but these are nothing compared to their eternal consequences, if they are unconfessed and unforgiven. Paul had <b class="calibre3">forewarned</b> the Thessalonians of this.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One of Britain’s most gifted writers of the nineteenth century fell into sexual sin and ended in prison and disgrace. He wrote:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The gods have given me almost everything. But I let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease…. Tired of being on the heights, I deliberately went to the depths in search for new sensation…. I grew careless of the lives of others. I took pleasure where it pleased me and passed on. I forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character, and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber, one has some day to cry aloud from the housetop. I ceased to be lord over myself. I was no longer the captain of my soul, and did not know it. I allowed pleasure to dominate me. I ended in horrible disgrace.<a id="calibre_link-17" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-50">11</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">He grew careless of the lives of others, or, as Paul would say, he transgressed and wronged <b class="calibre3">his brother in this matter</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:7</span> <b class="calibre3">God did not call us</b> on the basis of moral <b class="calibre3">uncleanness</b>, but in connection with lives of <b class="calibre3">holiness</b> and purity. He has called us from a cesspool of degradation, and has begun in us a lifelong process designed to make us more and more like Himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:8</span> Anyone who <b class="calibre3">rejects this</b> instruction isn’t simply despising the teaching of a <b class="calibre3">man</b>, such as Paul; he is defying, disregarding, flouting, and rejecting <b class="calibre3">God</b> Himself—<b class="calibre3">who has also given</b><a id="calibre_link-18" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-51">12</a> <b class="calibre3">us His</b> <span class="bi">Holy</span> <b class="calibre3">Spirit</b>. The word <span class="bi">Holy</span> is emphatic here. How can one who is indwelt by the <b class="calibre3">Holy Spirit</b> indulge in sexual sin?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that all members of the Trinity are mentioned in this paragraph. The Father (v. 3), the Son (v. 2), and the <b class="calibre3">Holy Spirit</b> (v. 8). Wonderful thought! All three Persons in the Godhead are interested and involved in the sanctification of the believer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The subject changes now from lust (vv. 1–8) to love (vv. 9–12), and the exhortation changes from abstain to abound.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-41" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-52">B. The Love That Thinks of Others (4:9, 10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">4:9</span> Not only is the believer to have a controlled body; he should also have a heart of love for his brothers in the Lord. <b class="calibre3">Love</b> is the key word of Christianity as sin is of heathenism.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There was <b class="calibre3">no need</b> to <b class="calibre3">write</b> to the Thessalonians about this virtue. They were <b class="calibre3">taught by God to love</b> their brothers, both by divine instinct (1 John 2:20, 27) and by the instruction of Christian teachers. The believers at Thessalonica distinguished themselves by loving all the Christians in all of Macedonia. By commending them for it, Paul memorialized them forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:10</span> As has been mentioned, brotherly kindness is not an achievement; it is something that must be practiced continually, and so Paul exhorts the believers to <b class="calibre3">increase more and more</b> in this grace.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Why is love of <b class="calibre3">the brethren</b> so important? Because where there is love, there is unity; and where there is unity, there is the Lord’s blessing (Ps. 133:1, 3).</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-42" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-53">C. The Life That Speaks to Outsiders (4:11, 12)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">4:11</span> Paul encouraged the saints to <b class="calibre3">aspire</b> to do three things. In today’s parlance the three commands in this verse would be:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Don’t seek after the limelight. Be content to be “little and unknown, loved and prized by Christ alone.”</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. <b class="calibre3">Mind your own business</b> instead of butting into other people’s affairs.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. Be self-supporting. Don’t be a parasite or a “moocher,” sponging off others.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:12</span> The fact that we are Christians and are looking for Christ’s coming does not relieve us of the practical responsibilities of life. We should remember that the world is watching us. Men judge our Savior by us. We should <b class="calibre3">walk properly toward</b> unbelievers and be independent of them financially.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-43" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">D. The Hope That Comforts Believers (4:13–18)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">4:13</span> OT believers had an imperfect and incomplete knowledge of what happened to a person at the time of death. To them <span class="bi">sheol</span> was an all-purpose word used to describe the disembodied state, of both believers and unbelievers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">They believed that everyone would die eventually, that apparently there would be one general resurrection at the end of the world, and then a final judgment. Martha reflected these sketchy views when she said, “I know that he (Lazarus) will rise again in the resurrection at the last day” (John 11:24).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Lord Jesus brought “life and immortality to light by the gospel” (2 Tim. 1:10). Today we know that the believer departs to be with Christ at the time of death (2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 1:21, 23). The unbeliever is said to be in Hades (Luke 16:22, 23). We know that not all believers will die, but that all will be changed (1 Cor. 15:51). We know that there will be more than one resurrection. At the Rapture, only believers will be raised (1 Cor. 15:23; 1 Thess. 4:16); the wicked dead will be raised at the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ (Rev. 20:5).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When Paul first went to Thessalonica, he taught the Christians about Christ’s coming to reign and the events that would follow. But in the meantime, problems had arisen regarding those saints who had died. Would their bodies remain in the graves until the last day? Would they be excluded from participation in Christ’s coming and in His glorious kingdom? To answer their questions and to allay their fears, Paul now describes the order of events at the time of Christ’s coming for his people.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The formula, <b class="calibre3">I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren</b>, is used to alert readers to an important announcement. Here the announcement concerns <b class="calibre3">those who have fallen asleep</b>, that is, those believers who have <i class="calibre5">died</i>. Sleep is used to describe the <i class="calibre5">bodies</i> of departed Christians, never their spirits or souls. Sleep is an appropriate simile of death, because in death a person seems to be sleeping. Even our word <i class="calibre5">cemetery</i> comes from a Greek word meaning “sleeping place” (<span class="calibre5">koimētērion</span>). And sleep is a familiar simile, because every night we act out this symbol of death, and every morning is like a resurrection.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Bible does not teach that the soul sleeps at the time of death. The rich man and Lazarus were both conscious in death (Luke 16:19–31). When the believer dies, he is “present with the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:8). To die is to “be with Christ,” a position which Paul speaks of as “gain” and as being “far better” (Phil. 1:21, 23). This would scarcely be true if the soul were sleeping!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Neither does the Bible teach annihilation. There is no cessation of being in death. The believer enjoys eternal life (Mark 10:30). The unbeliever suffers eternal punishment (Mark 9:48; Rev. 14:11).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">With regard to those saints who have died, the apostle says that there is no need for hopeless sorrow. He does not rule out sorrow; Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus, though He knew He would raise him in a few minutes (John 11:35–44). But he rules out the despairing grief of those who have no hope of heaven, of reunion, of anything but judgment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The expression <b class="calibre3">others who have no hope</b> invariably reminds me of a funeral I attended where the stricken relatives clustered around the casket of an unsaved relative and wailed inconsolably, “Oh, Marie, my God, my God, Marie!” It was an unforgettable scene of unrelieved hopelessness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:14</span> The basis of the believer’s hope is the resurrection of Christ. Just as surely as <b class="calibre3">we believe that Jesus died and rose again</b>, so we believe that those who have fallen asleep in Jesus will be raised and will participate in His coming. “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive” (1 Cor. 15:22). His resurrection is the pledge and proof of ours.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice the expression <b class="calibre3">sleep in Jesus</b> or “those who through Jesus sleep.” Knowing that it is merely the Lover of our souls giving sleep to the bodies of His beloved ones robs death of its terror.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Our positive assurance concerning those who have died in Christ is that <b class="calibre3">God will bring</b> them <b class="calibre3">with Him</b>. This may be understood in two ways:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. It may mean that at the time of the Rapture, God will raise the bodies of believers and bring them back to heaven with the Lord Jesus.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="2">2. Or it may mean that when Christ comes back to the earth to reign, God will bring back with Christ those who have died in faith. In other words, the apostle is saying, “Don’t worry that those who have died will miss out in the glory of the coming kingdom. God will bring them back with Jesus when the latter returns in power and great glory.” (This is the generally preferred meaning.)</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">But how can this be? Their bodies are now lying in the grave. How can they come back with Jesus? The answer is given in verses 15–17. Before Christ comes to set up His kingdom, He will return to take His own people home to be with Him in heaven. Then at a later date, He will come back with them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:15</span> How did Paul know this? His answer is, <b class="calibre3">this we say to you by the word of the Lord</b>. He received this as <span class="bi">a direct revelation</span> from <b class="calibre3">the Lord</b>. We are not told how he received it—whether by a vision, by an audible voice, or by the inward impression of the Holy Spirit. But it is definitely a truth unknown to men up to that time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then he goes on to explain that when Christ returns, the living saints will not have any precedence or advantage over sleeping saints.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In this verse Paul speaks of himself as one who would be <b class="calibre3">alive</b> at Christ’s <b class="calibre3">coming</b> (see also 1 Cor. 15:51, 52). However, in 2 Corinthians 4:14 and 5:1, he speaks of the possibility of his being among those who will be raised. The obvious conclusion is that we should look for the Lord to come at any moment, yet realize that we may be called to reach heaven by way of death.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:16</span> The exact order of events at Christ’s coming for His saints is now given. <b class="calibre3">The Lord Himself will descend from heaven</b>. He will not send an angel, but will come <b class="calibre3">Himself</b>!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It will be <b class="calibre3">with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God</b>. Several explanations have been offered as to the significance of these commanding sounds, but frankly it is almost impossible to speak with finality about them:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Some feel that the <b class="calibre3">shout</b> is the voice of the Lord Jesus Himself which raises the dead (John 5:25; 11:43, 44) and changes the living. Others, like Hogg and Vine, say that the shout is the archangel’s voice.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. <b class="calibre3">The voice of</b> Michael, the <b class="calibre3">archangel</b>, is commonly understood as an assembling command for the OT saints, since he is so closely associated with Israel (Dan. 12:1; Jude 9; Rev. 12:4–7). Others think its purpose is to revive Israel nationally. And still others suggest <b class="calibre3">the voice of an archangel</b> summons the angels as a military escort to accompany the Lord and His saints through enemy territory back to heaven (cf. Luke 16:22).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. <b class="calibre3">The trumpet of God</b> is the same as the last trumpet of 1 Corinthians 15:52, which has to do with the resurrection of believers at the time of the Rapture. It calls the saints to eternal blessing. It is not to be confused with the seventh trumpet of Revelation 11:15–18, which signals the final outpouring of judgment on the world during the Tribulation. The last <b class="calibre3">trumpet here</b> is the last for the church. The seventh trumpet of Revelation is the last for the unbelieving world (though it is never specifically called the “last trumpet”).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">The bodies of <b class="calibre3">the dead in Christ will rise first</b>. Whether this includes the OT saints is debatable. Those who think it does point out that the archangel’s voice is heard at this time, and that he is closely linked with the destinies of Israel (Dan. 12:1). Those who think that the OT saints will not be raised at the Rapture remind us that the phrase <b class="calibre3">in Christ</b> (<b class="calibre3">the dead in Christ</b>) is never applied to believers who lived before the Church Age; these believers will probably be raised at the end of the Tribulation (Dan. 12:2). In any case it is clear that this is definitely <b class="calibre3">not</b> a general resurrection. Not all the dead are raised at this time, but only <b class="calibre3">the dead in Christ</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:17</span> Then the living <b class="calibre3">shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air</b>. The word <span class="bi">Rapture</span>, which we use to describe this first phase of the Lord’s return, is derived from the verb used here in the Latin Bible meaning <span class="bi">caught up</span>.<a id="calibre_link-19" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-55">13</a> A “rapture” is a snatching away or a catching up. It is used of Philip in Acts 8:39, of Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:2, 4, and of the male Child in Revelation 12:5.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">The air</b> is Satan’s sphere (Eph. 2:2), so this is a triumphal gathering in open defiance of the devil right in his own stronghold.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Think of all that is included in these verses! The earth and the sea yielding up the dust of all the dead in Christ. Then the transforming miracle by which this dust is formed into glorified bodies, free forever from sickness, pain, and death. Then the space-flight to heaven. And all of this taking place in the twinkling of an eye (1 Cor. 15:52).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Men of the world have difficulty believing the account of the creation of man in Genesis 1 and 2. If they have difficulty with creation, what will they do with the Rapture—when God will recreate millions of people from the dust that has been buried, scattered, strewn, or swept up on the beaches of the world?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Men of the world are enthusiastic about space travel. But can their greatest exploits compare with the wonder of traveling to heaven in a split second without taking our own atmosphere with us, as the space men have to do when they go on short hops to outer space?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In connection with Christ’s coming there is a sound to hear, a sight to see, a miracle to feel, a meeting to enjoy, and a comfort to experience.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is also good to notice the recurrence of the word <b class="calibre3">Lord</b> in these verses: the <span class="bi">word</span> of the Lord (v. 15), the <span class="bi">coming</span> of the Lord (v. 15), the Lord <span class="bi">Himself</span> (v. 16), to <b class="calibre3">meet the Lord</b> (v. 17), to <b class="calibre3">always be with the Lord</b> (v. 17).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Forever <b class="calibre3">with the Lord</b>! Who can tell all the joy and blessedness that is included in these words?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">4:18</span> <b class="calibre3">Therefore comfort one another with these words</b>. Thoughts of the Lord’s coming do not produce terror for the believer. It is a hope that thrills and cheers and comforts.</p>

        <p class="sbt"><a class="xref" href="part0002.html#rsb38">INDICATIONS OF THE LAST TIMES</a></p>
        <p class="sbaft">There are many indications that the Rapture may be near. We consider the following as straws in the wind:</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. The formation of the State of Israel in 1948 (Luke 21:29). The fig tree (Israel) is shooting forth, that is, putting forth its leaves (Luke 21:29–31). For the first time in centuries, the Jews have a national existence in their own homeland. This means that the kingdom of God is near.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. The rise of many other nations (Luke 21:29). Jesus predicted that not only the fig tree would shoot forth but all the trees as well. We have recently witnessed the demise of colonial governments and the proliferation of new nations. It is an era of new nationalism.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="3">3. The return of Israel to the land in unbelief (Ezek. 36:24, 25). Ezekiel prophesied that it would only be after their return that they would be cleansed from their sins. Israel today is largely an agnostic nation; only a small (but very vocal) segment of the people are orthodox Jews.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="4">4. The ecumenical movement (Rev. 17, 18). We understand Babylon the Great to be a vast religious, political, and commercial system made up of apostate religious bodies that profess to be Christian, perhaps a merger of apostate Catholicism and apostate Protestantism. Christendom is becoming increasingly apostate (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Thess. 2:3) and is moving toward a world super-church.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="5">5. The worldwide increase in Spiritism (1 Tim. 4:1–3). It is sweeping over vast areas of the earth at this moment.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="6">6. The drastic decline of moral standards (2 Tim. 3:1–5). The daily newspapers offer plenty of evidence of this.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="7">7. Violence and civil disobedience (2 Thess. 2:7, 8). A spirit of lawlessness is abounding in the home, in national life, and even in the church.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="8">8. People with a form of godliness but denying its power (2 Tim. 3:5).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="9">9. The rise of the anti-Christian spirit (1 Jn. 2:18), manifested in the multiplication of false cults which profess to be Christian but deny every fundamental doctrine of the faith. They deceive by imitation (2 Tim. 3:8).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="10">10. The tendency for nations to confederate along lines that approximate the line-up of the latter day. The European Common Market, based on what is known as the Treaty of Rome, may lead to the revival of the Roman Empire—the ten toes of iron and clay (Dan. 2:32–35).</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="11">11. Denial of the impending intervention of God in the affairs of the world by way of judgment (2 Pet. 3:3, 4).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="sb">To these could be added indications such as earthquakes in many countries, the threat of worldwide famine, and the increasing hostility among nations (Matt. 24:6, 7). The failure of governments to maintain law and order and to suppress terrorism creates the climate for a world dictator. The building of nuclear arsenals gives added meaning to such questions as, “Who is able to make war with him?” meaning, the beast (Rev. 13:4). Worldwide television facilities may be the means for fulfilling Scriptures describing events that will be seen simultaneously all over the planet (Rev. 1:7).</p>
        <p class="sb">Most of these events are foreseen as occurring before Christ returns to the earth to reign. The Bible does not say they will take place before the Rapture but before His appearing in glory. If that is so, and if we see these trends developing already, then the obvious conclusion is that the Rapture must be near at hand.</p>

      <h3 id="calibre_link-44" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-56">E. The Day of the Lord (5:1–11)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">5:1</span> Bible teachers often apologize for chapter breaks, explaining that the subject should continue without interruption. But here the chapter break is appropriate. Paul begins a new subject. He leaves his discussion of the Rapture and turns to the Day of the Lord. The words translated <b class="calibre3">but concerning</b> (Gk. <span class="calibre5">peri de</span>) indicate a new line of thought, as so often in 1 Corinthians.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For true believers the Rapture is a comforting hope, but what will it mean for those who are outside of Christ? It will mean the beginning of a period referred to here as <b class="calibre3">the times and the seasons</b>. This period is primarily Jewish in character. During this time God will resume His dealings with the nation of Israel, and the endtime events to which the OT prophets pointed will occur. When the apostles asked Jesus when He would set up His kingdom, He answered that it was not for them to know the times and the seasons (Acts 1:7). It seems that <b class="calibre3">the times and the seasons</b> cover the period prior to the setting up of the kingdom as well as the kingdom period itself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul felt <b class="calibre3">no need</b> to <b class="calibre3">write to</b> the Thessalonians about <b class="calibre3">the times and the seasons</b>. For one thing, the saints would not be affected by them; they would be taken to heaven before these epochs began.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Also, <b class="calibre3">the times and the seasons</b> and the Day of the Lord are subjects that are found in the OT. The Rapture is a mystery (1 Cor. 15:51), never revealed until the time of the apostles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:2</span> The saints already knew about <b class="calibre3">the day of the Lord</b>. They knew that the exact time was unknown, and that it would come when least expected. What does Paul mean by <b class="calibre3">the day of the Lord</b>? It is certainly not a day of twenty-four hours, but a period of time with certain characteristics.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the OT this term was used to describe any time of judgment, desolation, and darkness (Isa. 2:12; 13:9–16; Joel 2:1, 2). It was a time when God marched forth against the enemies of Israel and punished them decisively (Zeph. 3:8–12; Joel 3:14–16; Obad. 15–17; Zech. 12:8, 9). But it was also any occasion on which God punished His own people for their idolatry and backsliding (Joel 1:15–20; Amos 5:18; Zeph. 1:7–18). Basically it spoke of judgment on sin, of victory for the cause of the Lord (Joel 2:31, 32), and untold blessing for His faithful people.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the future, <b class="calibre3">the day of the Lord</b> will cover approximately the same period as the times and the seasons. It will begin after the Rapture and will include:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The Tribulation (i.e., the time of Jacob’s trouble) (Dan. 9:27; Jer. 30:7; Matt. 24:4–28; 2 Thess 2:2; Rev. 6:1—19:16).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The coming of Christ with His saints (Mal. 4:1–3; 2 Thess 1:7–9).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. The thousand-year reign of Christ on the earth (Joel 3:18 [cf. v. 14]; Zech 14:8, 9 [cf. v. 1]).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. The final destruction of the heavens and earth by fire (2 Pet. 3:7, 10).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">The day of the Lord</b> is the time when Jehovah will publicly intervene in human affairs. It is characterized by judgment on the enemies of Israel and on the apostate portion of the nation of Israel, by deliverance of His people, by establishment of Christ’s kingdom of peace and prosperity, and glory for Himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle reminds his readers <b class="calibre3">that the day of the Lord</b> will come <b class="calibre3">as a thief in the night</b>. It will be completely unexpected, taking men off guard. The world will be wholly unprepared.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:3</span> This Day will also come deceptively, suddenly, destructively, inevitably, and inescapably.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There will be an air of confidence and security in the world. Then God’s judgment will suddenly begin to descend with vast destructive force. <b class="calibre3">Destruction</b> does not mean loss of being, or annihilation; it means loss of well-being, or ruin as far as the purpose of one’s existence is concerned. It will be as inevitable and unavoidable as <b class="calibre3">labor pains upon a pregnant woman</b>. From this judgment there will be no escape for unbelievers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:4</span> It is important to notice the change in pronouns from “they” and “them” in the previous verses to <b class="calibre3">you</b> and we in the following verses.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Day of the Lord will be a time of wrath for the unsaved world. But what will it mean to us? The answer is that we are not in danger because we <b class="calibre3">are not in darkness</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre3">This Day</b> will come as a thief in the night (v. 2). The only way it will <b class="calibre3">overtake</b> anyone is <b class="calibre3">as a thief</b>, and the only persons it will <b class="calibre3">overtake</b> will be those who are in the night, that is, the unconverted. It will not <b class="calibre3">overtake</b> believers at all, because they <b class="calibre3">are not in darkness</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">At first reading, this verse might seem to say that the Day of the Lord <b class="calibre3">will</b> overtake believers but <b class="calibre3">not as a thief</b>. But this is not so. It <b class="calibre3">will not overtake them at all</b> because when the thief comes to this world’s night, the saints will be dwelling in eternal light.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:5</span> All Christians are <b class="calibre3">sons of light and sons of the day</b>. They <b class="calibre3">are not of the night nor of darkness</b>. It is this fact that will exempt them from the judgment that God will pour out on the world that has rejected His Son. The judgments of the Day of the Lord are aimed only at those who are in moral darkness and spiritual night, at those who are alienated from God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When it says here that Christians are <b class="calibre3">sons of the day</b>, it does not mean the Day of the Lord. To be <b class="calibre3">sons of the day</b> means to be people who belong to the realm of moral uprightness. The Day of the Lord is a time of judgment on those who belong to the realm of moral darkness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:6</span> The next three verses call believers to a life that is consistent with their exalted position. This means watchfulness and sobriety. We are to <b class="calibre3">watch</b> against temptation, laziness, lethargy, and distraction. Positively, we should <b class="calibre3">watch</b> for the Savior’s return.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Sobriety here means not only being <b class="calibre3">sober</b> in conversation and in general demeanor but being temperate as far as food and drink are concerned.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:7</span> In the natural realm, <b class="calibre3">sleep</b> is associated with <b class="calibre3">night</b>. So in the spiritual realm, careless indifference characterizes those who are sons of darkness, that is, the unconverted.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Men prefer to carry on their drunken revelry <b class="calibre3">at night</b>; they love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil (John 3:19). The very name “night club” links the ideas of drinking and carousing with the darkness of night.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:8</span> Those <b class="calibre3">who are of the day</b> should walk in the light as He is in the light (1 Jn. 1:7). This means judging and forsaking sin, and avoiding excesses of all kinds. It also means putting on the Christian armor and keeping it on. The armor consists of <b class="calibre3">the breastplate of faith and love</b> and the <b class="calibre3">helmet</b> of <b class="calibre3">the hope of salvation</b>. In other words, the armor is <b class="calibre3">faith</b>, <b class="calibre3">love</b>, and <b class="calibre3">hope</b>—the three cardinal elements of Christian character. It is not necessary to press the details of <b class="calibre3">the breastplate</b> and <b class="calibre3">helmet</b>. The apostle is simply saying that sons of light should wear the protective covering of a consistent, godly life. What preserves us from the corruption that is in the world through lust? <b class="calibre3">Faith</b>, or dependence on God. <b class="calibre3">Love</b> for the Lord and for one another. The <b class="calibre3">hope</b> of Christ’s return.</p>

      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:9</span> The Rapture has two aspects, <b class="calibre3">salvation</b> and <b class="calibre3">wrath</b>. For the believer it means the consummation of his <b class="calibre3">salvation</b> in heaven. For the unbeliever, it means the ushering in of a time of <b class="calibre3">wrath</b> on earth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Since we are of the day, <b class="calibre3">God did not appoint us to</b> the <b class="calibre3">wrath</b> which He will pour out during the Tribulation Period, but rather to <b class="calibre3">salvation</b> in its fullest sense—freedom forever from the very presence of sin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Some understand <b class="calibre3">wrath</b> here to refer to the punishment which unbelievers will suffer in hell. Of course it is true that God has not appointed us to that, but it is gratuitous to introduce that thought here. Paul is not talking about hell, but about future events on earth. The context deals with the Day of the Lord—the greatest period of <b class="calibre3">wrath</b> in the history of man on earth (Matt. 24:21). We do not have an appointment with the executioner but with the Savior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Some say that the Tribulation is the time of Satan’s wrath (Rev. 12:12), not the wrath of God. They say that the church will experience the wrath of Satan, but will be delivered from the wrath of God at the Second Coming of Christ. However, the following verses speak of the wrath of God and of the Lamb, and their setting is during the Tribulation Period: Revelation 6:16, 17; 14:9, 10, 19; 15:1, 7; 16:1, 19.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:10</span> This verse emphasizes the tremendous price our Lord Jesus Christ paid to deliver us from wrath and insure our salvation. He <b class="calibre3">died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are two ways of understanding the expression <b class="calibre3">whether we wake or sleep</b>. Some scholars understand it to mean “living or dead” at the time of the Rapture. They point out that there will be two classes of believers at that time—those who have died in Christ and those who are still living. So the thought would be that whether we are among the living or the dead at the time of Christ’s return, <b class="calibre3">we</b> shall <b class="calibre3">live together with Him</b>. Christians who die lose nothing. The Lord explained this to Martha: “I am the resurrection and the life: he who believes in Me, though he may die [i.e., a Christian who dies before the Rapture], he shall live [he will be raised from among the dead]. And whoever lives and believes in Me [a believer who is alive at the time of the Rapture] shall never die …” (John 11:25, 26).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The other view held by scholars is that <b class="calibre3">wake or sleep</b> means “watchful or worldly.” In other words, Paul is saying that whether we are spiritually alert or carnally indifferent to spiritual things, we will be caught up to meet the Lord. Our eternal salvation does not depend on our spiritual keenness during the closing moments of our time on earth. If truly converted, <b class="calibre3">we</b> will <b class="calibre3">live together with Him</b> when He comes again, whether we are on the tiptoes of expectancy or in the prone position of slumber. Our spiritual condition will determine our rewards, but our salvation depends on faith in Christ alone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Those who hold this second view point out that the word for <b class="calibre3">wake</b> is the same word translated “watch” in verse 6. And the word for <b class="calibre3">sleep</b> is used in verses 6 and 7 to mean “insensitivity to divine things, involving conformity to the world” (Vine). But it is <b class="calibre3">not</b> the same word used in 4:13, 14, 15 to mean death.<a id="calibre_link-20" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-57">14</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:11</span> In view of so great salvation, in love for so great a Savior, and in the light of His soon return, we should exhort one another by teaching, encouragement, and example, and we should build each other up with the word of God and with loving care. Because we will live together with Him then, we should live together with one another cooperatively now.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-45" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-58">F. Varied Exhortations to the Saints (5:12–22)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">5:12</span> Perhaps the elders of the church in Thessalonica had rebuked those who had quit working and were “mooching off” others. And no doubt the drones didn’t take the rebuke too well! That may account for this exhortation to the leaders and to those led.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When Paul urges the saints <b class="calibre3">to recognize those who labor among</b> them, he means to respect and obey their spiritual guides. This is clear from the words <b class="calibre3">“and are over you in the Lord and admonish you.”</b> Elders are undershepherds of God’s sheep. Their responsibility is to teach, rule, and warn.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse is one of many in the NT that shows that there was no one-man rule in the apostolic churches. There was a group of elders in each congregation, pastoring the local flock. As Denney explains:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">At Thessalonica there was not a single president, a minister in our sense, possessing to a certain extent an exclusive responsibility; the presidence was in the hands of a plurality of men.<a id="calibre_link-21" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-59">15</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">However, the absence of <b class="calibre3">one-man</b> rule does not justify <b class="calibre3">every-man</b> rule. The assembly should not be a <b class="calibre3">democracy</b>, but an <b class="calibre3">aristocracy</b>, the rule of the <b class="calibre3">best</b> qualified.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:13</span> Elders serve as representatives of the Lord. Their work is the work of God. For that reason, they should be held in high regard and <b class="calibre3">love</b>.<a id="calibre_link-22" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-60">16</a> The exhortation <b class="calibre3">“be at peace among yourselves”</b> is no incidental insertion. The number one problem among Christians everywhere is the problem of getting along with each other. Every believer has enough of the flesh in him to divide and wreck any local church. Only as empowered by the Spirit can we develop the love, brokenness, forbearance, kindness, tender-heartedness, and forgiveness that are indispensable for <b class="calibre3">peace</b>. A particular threat to <b class="calibre3">peace</b> which Paul may be warning against is the formation of cliques around human leaders.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:14</span> This verse seems to be addressed to the spiritual leaders of the congregation; it tells them how to deal with problem brothers:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. <b class="calibre3">Warn those who are unruly</b>—those who won’t keep in step but insist on disturbing the peace of the church by their irresponsible behavior. Here the <b class="calibre3">unruly</b> are those who refuse to work. They are the same as those described in 2 Thessalonians 3:6–12, walking disorderly, not working, but being busybodies.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. <b class="calibre3">Comfort the fainthearted</b>—those who need constant exhortation to rise above their difficulties and go on steadfastly for the Lord. Concerning the KJV rendering, <b class="calibre3">Comfort the feeble-minded</b>, Ockenga remarks: “If the word meant feeble-minded we would still comfort them. They seem to gather when the gospel is preached.” And isn’t this a tribute to the gospel and to the Christian church? At least there is one sphere where they find sympathy, love, and consideration.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. <b class="calibre3">Uphold the weak</b>—that is, help those who are spiritually, morally, or physically weak. Spiritual and moral support of those who are <b class="calibre3">weak</b> in the faith is probably the main idea, though we should not rule out financial help as well.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. <b class="calibre3">Be patient with all</b>—show the grace of longsuffering when others tend to irritate and provoke.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:15</span> Speaking now to Christians in general, Paul forbids any thought of retaliation. The natural reaction is to strike back, to return tit for tat. But the Christian should be so in fellowship with the Lord Jesus that he will react in a supernatural way. In other words, he will instinctively show kindness and love to other believers and to the unsaved as well.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:16</span> Joy can be the constant experience of the Christian, even in the most adverse circumstances, because Christ is the source and subject of his joy, and Christ is in control of the circumstances. Incidentally, <b class="calibre3">“Rejoice always”</b> is the shortest verse in the Greek NT, even if “Jesus wept” is the shortest in the English.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:17</span> Prayer should be the constant attitude of the Christian—not that he abandons his regular duties and gives himself wholly to prayer. He prays at certain regular times; he also prays extemporaneously as need arises; and he enjoys continual communion with the Lord by prayer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:18</span> Giving <b class="calibre3">thanks</b> to God should be the Christian’s native emotion. If Romans 8:28 is true, then we should be able to praise the Lord at all times, in all circumstances, and for <b class="calibre3">everything</b>, just as long as in doing so we do not excuse sin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These three good habits have been called the standing orders of the church. They represent <b class="calibre3">the will of God in Christ Jesus for</b> us. The words <b class="calibre3">in Christ Jesus</b> remind us that He taught us these things during His earthly ministry and He was the living embodiment of what He taught. By teaching and example, He revealed to us God’s will concerning joy, prayer, and thanksgiving.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:19</span> The next four verses seem to deal with behavior in the assembly.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">To <b class="calibre3">quench the Spirit</b> means to stifle His work in our midst, to limit and hinder Him. Sin quenches the Spirit. Traditions quench Him. Man-made rules and regulations in public worship quench Him. Disunity quenches Him. Someone has said, “Cold looks, contemptuous words, silence, studied disregard, go a long way to quench Him. So does unsympathetic criticism.” Ryrie says that the Spirit is quenched whenever His ministry is stifled in an individual or in the church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:20</span> If we link this verse with the previous one, then the thought is that we quench the Spirit when we <b class="calibre3">despise</b> prophesyings. For instance, a young brother may make some inelegant statement in public ministry. By criticizing him in such a way as to make him ashamed of his testimony for Christ we quench the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In its primary NT sense, to prophesy meant to speak the word of God. The inspired utterances of the prophets are preserved for us in the Bible. In a secondary sense, to prophesy means to declare the mind of God as it has been revealed in the Bible.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:21</span> We must evaluate what we hear and <b class="calibre3">hold fast what is good</b>, genuine, and true. The standard by which we <b class="calibre3">test</b> all preaching and teaching is the word of God. There will be abuses from time to time wherever the Spirit has liberty to speak through different brethren. But quenching the Spirit is not the way to remedy these abuses.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As Dr. Denney wrote:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">An open meeting, a liberty of prophesying, a gathering in which any one could speak as the Spirit gave him utterance is one of the crying needs of the modern Church.<a id="calibre_link-23" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-61">17</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:22</span> <b class="calibre3">Abstain from every form of evil</b> may mean false tongues, prophecies, or teachings, or it may mean <b class="calibre3">evil</b> in general.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A. T. Pierson points out that there are seven distinct frames of mind for the Christian in verses 16–22:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The praiseful frame (16). Finding all God’s dealings to be infinitely grand.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The prayerful frame (17). Prayer should never be unsuitable or unseemly.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. The thankful frame (18). Even in circumstances not pleasant to the flesh.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. The spiritual frame (19). He should have full liberty in and through us.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="5">5. The teachable frame (20). <b class="calibre3">Any</b> channel which God chooses to use.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="6">6. The judicial frame (21). Compare 1 John 4:1. Test all by the word of God.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="7">7. The hallowed frame (22). If evil takes shape in your mind, avoid that evil.<a id="calibre_link-24" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-62">18</a></li>

      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre3">5:23</span> Now Paul prays for the sanctification of the Christians. The source is <b class="calibre3">the God of peace</b>. The scope is found in the word <b class="calibre3">completely</b>, meaning “every part of your being.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse has been pressed into service by some to prove the “Holiness” doctrine of entire sanctification—that a believer can become <span class="bi">sinlessly perfect</span> in this life. However, that is not what Paul means when he prays, <b class="calibre3">the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely</b>. He is not praying for the eradication of the sin nature but rather that sanctification would extend to every part of their being—<b class="calibre3">spirit, soul, and body</b>.</p>

        <p class="sbt"><a class="xref" href="part0002.html#rsb39">SANCTIFICATION</a></p>
        <p class="sbaft">There are four phases of sanctification in the NT—pre-conversion, positional, practical or progressive, and perfect.</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. Even before a person is saved, he is set apart in a position of external privilege. Thus we read in 1 Corinthians 7:14 that an unbelieving husband is sanctified by his believing wife. This is <b class="calibre3">pre-conversion sanctification</b>.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. Whenever a person is born again, he is <b class="calibre3">positionally sanctified</b> by virtue of his union with Christ. This means that he is set apart to God from the world. It is referred to in such passages as Acts 26:18; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 6:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; Hebrews 10:10, 14.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="3">3. But then there is <b class="calibre3">progressive sanctification</b>. This is a present setting apart of the believer to God from the world, sin, and self. It is the process by which he becomes more Christlike. This is the sanctification which Paul prays for the Thessalonians here. It is also found in 1 Thessalonians 4:3, 4; 2 Timothy 2:21. It is brought about by the Holy Spirit when we are obedient to the word of God (John 17:17; 2 Cor. 3:18). Such practical sanctification is a process that should continue as long as the believer is on earth. He will never achieve perfection or sinlessness on earth, but he should ever be pressing toward that goal.</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="4">4. <b class="calibre3">Perfect sanctification</b> refers to the believer’s final condition in heaven. When he goes to be with the Lord, he will be morally like the Lord, completely and finally set apart from sin (1 Jn. 3:1–3).</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="figure">
        <p class="fig"><img src="00001.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre6"/></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle also prays for the preservation of the Thessalonians. This preservation should include the complete person—<b class="calibre3">spirit, soul, and body</b>. Notice the order. Man always says body, soul, and spirit. God always says <b class="calibre3">spirit, soul, and body</b>. In the original creation, the spirit was of first importance, the body last. Sin reversed the order; man lives for the body and neglects the spirit. When we pray for one another, we should follow the biblical order, putting spiritual welfare before physical needs.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">From this verse and others, it is clear that we are tripartite beings. Our <b class="calibre3">spirit</b> is that part which enables us to have communion with God. Our <b class="calibre3">soul</b> has to do with our emotions, desires, affections, and propensities (John 12:27). Our <b class="calibre3">body</b> is the house in which our person dwells (2 Cor. 5:1).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">All of our parts need to <b class="calibre3">be preserved</b> entire, that is, complete and sound. One commentator has suggested the needs for preservation as follows:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The spirit from (a) everything that would defile it (2 Cor. 7:1); (b) everything that would hinder the testimony of the Holy Spirit to the saints’ relationship with God (Rom. 8:16); or (c) everything that would prevent the worship which He seeks (John 4:23; Phil 3:3).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The soul from (a) evil thoughts (Matt. 15:18, 19; Eph. 2:3); (b) fleshly appetites that war against it (1 Pet. 2:11); and (c) contention and strife (Heb. 12:15).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. The body from (a) defilement (1 Thess. 4:3–8); and (b) evil uses (Rom. 6:19).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Some deny that the unsaved have a spirit. Perhaps they base this on the fact that they are spiritually dead (Eph. 2:1). However, the fact that the unsaved are spiritually dead does not mean that they have <span class="bi">no</span> spirit. It means that they are dead as far as fellowship with God is concerned. Their spirits may be very much alive, for example, as far as contact with the world of the <span class="bi">occult</span> is concerned, but they are dead <span class="bi">Godward</span>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Lenski warns:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Many are satisfied with a partial Christianity, some parts of their life are still worldly. The apostolic admonitions constantly prod into all the corners of our nature so that none may escape purification.<a id="calibre_link-25" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-4">19</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The prayer goes on to desire that God’s sanctification and preservation will so extend to every part of their personalities that the believers will be <b class="calibre3">blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. This seems to point to the Judgment Seat of Christ, which follows the Rapture. At that time, the Christian’s life, service, and testimony will be reviewed, and he will be rewarded or suffer loss.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:24</span> As we learned in 4:3, our sanctification is the will of God. He has called us to eventually stand blameless before Him. Having begun this work in us, He will finish it (Phil. 1:6). <b class="calibre3">He who calls</b> us <b class="calibre3">is faithful</b> to His promise.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:25</span> As Paul closes, he asks for the prayers of the saints. He never outgrew the need for prayer and neither do we. It is a sin to fail to <b class="calibre3">pray for</b> fellow believers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:26</span> Next he asks that <b class="calibre3">all the brethren</b> be greeted <b class="calibre3">with a holy kiss</b>. At that time, this was the accepted mode of greeting. In some countries it is still customary for men to kiss men, and women to kiss women. In still other cultures men kiss the women and vice versa. But more often than not this has led to abuses and has had to be abandoned.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The kiss was not instituted by the Lord as a prescribed form of greeting or taught by the apostles as obligatory. The Bible wisely allows for other modes of greeting in cultures where kissing might lead to sexual laxness. The Spirit of God seeks to guard against such irregularities by insisting that the <b class="calibre3">kiss</b> must be <b class="calibre3">holy</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:27</span> The apostle solemnly charges <b class="calibre3">that this epistle be read to all the holy</b><a id="calibre_link-26" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-5">20</a> <b class="calibre3">brethren</b>. Two points should be noted here:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Paul invests the Letter with the authority of the word of God. The OT was read publicly in the synagogues. Now <b class="calibre3">this epistle</b> will <b class="calibre3">be read</b> aloud in the churches.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="2">2. The Bible is for all Christians, not for some inside circle or privileged class. All its truths are for all the saints.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Denney wisely insists:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">There is no attainment in wisdom or in goodness which is barred against any man by the gospel; and there is no surer mark of faithlessness and treachery in a church than this, that it keeps its members in a perpetual pupilage or minority, discouraging the free use of Holy Scripture, and taking care that all it contains is not read to all the brethren.<a id="calibre_link-27" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-6">21</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that in verses 25–27 we have three keys to a successful Christian life: (1) prayer (v. 25); (2) love for fellow believers, which speaks of fellowship (v. 26); and (3) reading and study of the word (v. 27).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre3">5:28</span> Finally we have Paul’s characteristic close. He opened his First Epistle to the Thessalonians with grace, and now he closes it with the same theme. To the apostle Christianity is <b class="calibre3">grace</b> from beginning to end. <b class="calibre3">Amen</b>.</p>

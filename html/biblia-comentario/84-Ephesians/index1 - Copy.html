<h2 id="calibre_link-137" class="ah">I. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
      <p class="paft">In some ways Ephesians is a typical Pauline Epistle: the salutation, the thanksgiving, the development of doctrine followed by the application of that doctrine as our duty, and the closing greetings. Yet Ephesians, while a genuine letter, is almost like a sermon or even a Christian service with prayers and a doxology. In this letter, as Moorehead writes, “We pass into the stillness and hush of the sanctuary…. Here prevails the atmosphere of repose, of meditation, of worship and peace.”<a id="calibre_link-70" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-26">1</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">In spite of the fact that so many commentators agree with Robinson’s evaluation quoted above, some modern scholars, abandoning eighteen or nineteen centuries of Christian teaching, claim Paul could not have written Ephesians. But is this a valid viewpoint in light of the facts?</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-139" class="ah">II. Authorship</h2>
      <p class="paft">As far as the <i class="calibre3">external evidence</i> that Ephesians is an authentic Pauline Epistle, the case is solid and strong. No other Pauline Epistle has such an early and continuous stream of witnesses, starting with Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, and Hermas, and going on with Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, and Hippolytus. Marcion included it in his “canon,” though calling it “Laodiceans.” The Muratorian Canon also lists Ephesians as by Paul.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">Internal evidence</i> includes the fact that the author twice <i class="calibre3">says</i> he is Paul (1:1 and 3:1), and the contents of the letter are so similar (in <i class="calibre3">some</i> respects) to Colossians that they must have been written close to one another in time. The structure of Ephesians, as was mentioned, is typically Pauline. Granted, Paul does introduce some new thoughts in this book, but if a writer cannot do so without being accused of being a forger, the opportunities for biblical writers helping to mature the saints will prove difficult indeed!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The German liberal Schleiermacher was probably the first to reject Pauline authorship. Many moderns have followed suit, such as Moffatt and Goodspeed. Vocabulary, style, “advanced” doctrine, and other subjective arguments are mustered to deny this book to the apostle. However, every one of these theories can be answered satisfactorily. In light of the overwhelming external evidence and the large number of scholarly commentators who see Ephesians as not merely in the spirit of Paul, but, as Coleridge expressed it, his very “divinest writing,” the letter should be accepted as genuine.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-141" class="ah">III. Date</h2>
      <p class="paft">Along with Colossians, Philippians, and Philemon, Ephesians is one of the so-called “Prison Epistles.” <i class="calibre3">Which</i> imprisonment is involved (3:1; 4:1) has been debated. While some believe it was Paul’s two-year stay in Caesarea, or even an unproven Ephesian imprisonment, the weight of evidence seems to come down on the first Roman imprisonment (soon after <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 60). Like Colossians (4:7–9), this letter was carried to the province of Asia by Tychicus (6:21, 22). This explains the similarity of doctrinal content, the same ideas being fresh in the apostle’s mind as he wrote these letters.</p>

<section id="calibre_link-142" type="chapter">
<h2 id="calibre_link-143" class="ah">IV. Background and Theme</h2>
      <p class="paft">The main subject of Ephesians is what Paul calls “the mystery.” By that he does not mean something that cannot be explained, but rather a wonderful truth never revealed before but now made known.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This sublime truth, which forms the theme of the book, is the announcement that believing Jews and believing Gentiles are now one in Christ Jesus. They are fellow members of the church, the Body of Christ. At the present time they are seated in Christ in heavenly places. In the future they will share His glory as Head over all things.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The mystery is found in each of Ephesians’ six chapters.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In chapter 1 it is called the mystery of God’s will, and looks forward to the time when all things in heaven and on earth will be headed up in Christ (vv. 9, 10). Believing Jews (v. 11, “we”) and believing Gentiles (v. 13, “you”) will have their share in the glory of that day. They will reign with Him over the whole universe as His Body and His fullness (vv. 22, 23).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Chapter 2 describes the process by which Jews and Gentiles are saved by the grace of God; how they are reconciled to God and to one another; how, in union with Christ, they become one new man; and how they form a holy temple in which God dwells by His Spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Chapter 3 gives the most complete explanation of the mystery. There it is spoken of as the mystery of “the Christ” (v. 4 JND), meaning Christ, the Head, and all believers, His Body. In this Body, believing Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members, and fellow partakers of God’s promise (v. 6).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Chapter 4 emphasizes the unity of the Body and God’s plan for its growth to maturity (vv. 1–16).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In chapter 5, the mystery is called Christ and the church (v. 32). The relationship between Christ and the church is the pattern for the relationship between a believing husband and wife.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, in chapter 6, Paul speaks of the mystery of the gospel, for which he was an ambassador in chains (vv. 19, 20).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Try to imagine the impact of this news on the Gentile believers to whom it was sent. Not only were they saved by grace through faith, the same as the Jews, but for the first time they occupied a place of equal privilege with them. They were in no way inferior as far as their standing before God was concerned. And they were destined to be enthroned with Christ as His Body and His Bride, sharing the glory of His universal reign.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Another important theme of Ephesians is <i class="calibre3">love</i> (Greek, <span class="calibre3">agapē</span>, the love expressed through the will). Paul starts and ends his Epistle with this concept (1:4; 6:24), and uses the verb and noun more in Ephesians than anywhere else in his Letters. This may show the Holy Spirit’s foreknowledge, because while thirty years in the future the large and active congregation would still be obeying the command to fight false doctrine, our Lord tells them in His Letter to Ephesus that He held it against them that they had left their first <i class="calibre3">love</i> (Rev. 2:4).</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-118" class="ahaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-28">I. THE BELIEVER’S POSITION IN CHRIST (Chaps. 1–3)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-119" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-29">A. Salutation (1:1, 2)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:1</span> The name <b class="calibre5">Paul</b> means “small.” Although physically he may have fitted this description, spiritually his influence was enormous. He introduces himself as <b class="calibre5">an apostle of Jesus Christ</b>. This means he was commissioned by the ascended Lord to perform a special mission. That mission was to preach <i class="calibre3">the gospel</i> to the Gentiles and to teach the great truth concerning <i class="calibre3">the church</i> (3:8, 9). Since Ephesians deals with the church, and since this truth was first revealed to the apostles and prophets (3:5), it is fitting that Paul should introduce himself as <b class="calibre5">an apostle</b>. It was not a mark of pride to do so; rather it was an explanation of how he could speak with authority on the subject. The source of his authority is expressed in the words, <b class="calibre5">by the will of God</b>. Paul did not choose his work as an occupation. And no men appointed him to it. It was a divine call from beginning to end (Gal. 1:1).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The letter is addressed <b class="calibre5">to the saints who are in Ephesus, and faithful in Christ Jesus</b>. <b class="calibre5">Saints</b> are people who have been separated to God from the world. It is a name which is applied in the NT to all born-again believers. Basically the word refers to a believer’s position <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b> rather than to what he is in himself. <b class="calibre5">In Christ</b> all believers are <b class="calibre5">saints</b>, even though in themselves they are not always saintly. For instance, Paul addressed the Corinthians as saints (1 Cor. 1:2), even though it is clear from what follows that they were not all living holy lives. Yet God’s will is that our practice should correspond to our position: <b class="calibre5">saints</b> should be saintly.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And faithful in Christ Jesus</b>. The word, <b class="calibre5">faithful</b> means “believing ones” and is thus a description of all true Christians. Of course, believers should also be <b class="calibre5">faithful</b> in the sense that they are reliable and trustworthy. But the primary thought here is that they had acknowledged <b class="calibre5">Christ Jesus</b> to be their only Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Two of the oldest manuscripts omit the words <b class="calibre5">in Ephesus</b> although they stand in most manuscripts. Many scholars think this was a circular letter, written to be read by local gatherings of Christians in several places, of which the church at Ephesus was the most prominent. Fortunately the question affects neither the authenticity of the letter nor its value for us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:2</span> Next comes the apostle’s greeting to the saints. Every word is loaded with spiritual significance—unlike many of the empty greetings we use today.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Grace</b> means divine assistance for daily living. Paul’s readers had already been saved by the grace of God, His undeserved favor to the lost. But now they needed strength <b class="calibre5">from God</b> to face the problems, trials, and sorrows of life. That is what the apostle wishes for them here.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Peace</b> means a spirit at rest in all the changing circumstances of life. The saints had already experienced peace <i class="calibre3">with</i> God when they were converted. But day by day they needed the <b class="calibre5">peace</b> <i class="calibre3">of</i> God, that is, the calm, settled repose that is independent of circumstances and that results from taking everything to God in prayer (Phil. 4:6, 7).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is worth noticing that <b class="calibre5">grace</b> comes first, then <b class="calibre5">peace</b>. This is always the order. Only after <b class="calibre5">grace</b> has dealt with the sin question can <b class="calibre5">peace</b> be known. And only through the undeserved strength which God gives from day to day can the believer experience <b class="calibre5">peace</b>, perfect <b class="calibre5">peace</b>, in all the changing moods of life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Grace</b> (<span class="calibre3">charis</span>) was a characteristically Greek word. The Jews use the word <b class="calibre5">peace</b> (Heb. <span class="calibre3">shâlōm</span>) as a greeting. Put them together and we have, in miniature, the gospel for the whole world. When we unite them we also have the truth of the NT church which Paul expounds so fully in Ephesians—Jew and Gentile formed into one Body in Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Grace … and peace</b> come <b class="calibre5">from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</b>. Paul did not hesitate to put the <b class="calibre5">Lord Jesus</b> on the same level as <b class="calibre5">God</b> the Father: he honored the Son just as he honored the <b class="calibre5">Father</b>. So should we (John 5:23).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Let us not overlook the marvelous conjunction of the words <b class="calibre5">God our Father</b>. The word <b class="calibre5">God</b> taken by itself might convey the impression of One who is infinitely high and unapproachable. The name <b class="calibre5">Father</b>, on the other hand, speaks of One who is intimately near and accessible. Join the two by the pronoun <b class="calibre5">our</b> and we have the staggering truth that the high and lofty <b class="calibre5">God</b>, who inhabits eternity, is the loving <b class="calibre5">Father</b> of everyone who has been born again through faith in the <b class="calibre5">Lord Jesus.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The full title of our Savior is <b class="calibre5">Lord Jesus Christ</b>. As <b class="calibre5">Lord</b> He is our absolute Master, with full rights to all we are and have. As <b class="calibre5">Jesus</b> He is our Savior from sin. As <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> He is our divinely anointed Prophet, Priest, and King. How much His name unfolds to every listening ear!</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-120" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-30">B. Paul’s Praise to God for the Blessings of Grace (1:3–14)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:3</span> Following his brief salutation, the apostle lifts his voice in a magnificent hymn of praise, soaring into some of the sublimest heights of NT worship. Here we have the overflow of a heart that adores God for the blessings of grace. In these verses (3–14) Paul traces God’s activity in salvation from eternity past through time and on into eternity future. And this necessarily involves a discussion of the mystery of God’s will—believing Jews and Gentiles as co-sharers of the glorious inheritance.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He begins by calling on all who know <b class="calibre5">God</b> to bless Him, that is, to bring joy to His heart by praise and worshiping love. The <b class="calibre5">blessed</b> One is <b class="calibre5">the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. At certain times Jesus addressed God as God (Matt. 27:46). At other times He spoke of Him as Father (John 10:30). The <b class="calibre5">blessed</b> One is also the Blesser. We bless Him by praising Him. He blesses us and makes us glad by showering us with the riches of His grace.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He <b class="calibre5">has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ</b>. Here is a pyramid of grace:</p>
      <div class="written">
        <p class="wlf">blessing</p>
        <p class="wlf">spiritual blessing</p>
        <p class="wlf">every spiritual blessing</p>
        <p class="wlf">every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places</p>
        <p class="wls">every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ</p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft">Notice first how unstinted are His heart and hand—<b class="calibre5">every spiritual blessing</b>. Notice, too, that these are <i class="calibre3">spiritual</i> blessings. The simplest way to explain this is to contrast them with the blessings of Israel under the law. In the OT, a faithful, obedient Jew was rewarded with long life, a large family, abundant crops, and protection from his enemies (Deut. 28:2–8). The blessings of Christianity, in contrast, are <b class="calibre5">spiritual</b>, that is, they deal with treasures that are nonmaterial, invisible, and imperishable. It is true that the OT saints also enjoyed some spiritual blessings, but as we shall see, the Christian today enjoys blessings that were unknown in previous times.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Our blessings are <i class="calibre3">in the heavenly places</i>, literally “<i class="calibre3">in the heavenlies</i>.” Instead of being material blessings in earthly places, they are <b class="calibre5">spiritual</b> blessings <i class="calibre3">in the heavenly places</i>. The expression <b class="calibre5">in the heavenly places</b> is used five times in Ephesians:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">1:3 The sphere of our <b class="calibre5">spiritual</b> blessing</li>
        <li class="ul">1:20 The scene of Christ’s present enthronement</li>
        <li class="ul">2:6 The scene of our present enthronement in Christ</li>
        <li class="ul">3:10 The locale from which angels witness God’s wisdom exhibited in the church</li>
        <li class="ull">6:12 The region which is the source of our present conflict with evil spirits</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paft">When we put these passages together, we have a truly scriptural definition of <b class="calibre5">the heavenly places</b>. As Unger put it, they are “the realm of the believer’s position and experience as a result of his being united to Christ by the baptism of the Spirit.” All <b class="calibre5">spiritual</b> blessings are <i class="calibre3">in Christ</i>. It was He who procured them for us through His finished work at Calvary. Now they are available through Him. Everything that God has for the believer is in the Lord Jesus. In order to receive the blessings, we must be united to Christ by faith. The moment a man is <i class="calibre3">in Christ</i>, he becomes the possessor of them all. Chafer writes, “To be in Christ, which is the portion of all who are saved, is to partake of all that Christ has done, all that He is, and all that He ever will be.”<a id="calibre_link-71" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-31">2</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">In Christ</i> is one of the key expressions of Ephesians. There are two closely related lines of truth in the NT—the truth of the believer’s position and the truth of his practice.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, the believer’s position. Everyone in the world is either “in Adam” or “in Christ.” Those who are “in Adam” are in their sins and therefore condemned before God. There is nothing they can do in themselves to please God or gain His favor. They have no claim on God, and if they were to receive what they deserve, they would perish eternally.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When a person is converted, God no longer looks upon him as a condemned child of Adam. Rather He sees him as being <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>, and He accepts him on that basis. It is important to see this. The believing sinner is not accepted because of what he is in himself, but because he is <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>. When he is <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>, he stands before God clothed in all the acceptability of Christ Himself. And he will enjoy God’s favor and acceptance as long as Christ does, namely, forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The believer’s position, then, is what he is <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>. But there is another side to the picture—the believer’s practice. This is what he is in himself. His position is perfect, but his practice is imperfect. Now God’s will is that his practice should increasingly correspond to his position. It never will do so perfectly until he is in heaven. But the process of sanctification, growth, and increasing Christlikeness should be going on continually while he is here on earth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When we understand the difference between the believer’s standing and his state, it enables us to reconcile such seemingly opposite verses as the following:</p>

      <p class="paft">The first column deals with position, the second with practice.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians itself is divided into two halves that parallel this truth: (Chaps. 1–3): Our position—what we are in Christ; (Chaps. 4–6): Our practice—what we should be in ourselves. The first half has to do with doctrine, the second half with duty. In the first three chapters our position is often described by such phrases as “in Christ,” “in Christ Jesus,” “in Him,” “in whom.” In the last three chapters the phrase “in the Lord” is often used to express the believer’s responsibility to Christ as Lord. Someone has well said that the first part of the letter pictures the believer in the heavenlies in Christ, whereas the last part views him in the kitchen.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Now we are ready to consider some of the <b class="calibre5">spiritual</b> blessings <b class="calibre5">in the heavenly places</b> which are ours <b class="calibre5">in Christ.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:4</span> The first is what is commonly known as election. <b class="calibre5">Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice first the positive fact of election in the words <b class="calibre5">He chose us</b>. Then there is the positional aspect of the truth, <b class="calibre5">in Him</b>: It is in the Person and work of the Lord Jesus that all God’s purposes for His people are brought to pass. The time of God’s election is indicated by the expression <b class="calibre5">before the foundation of the world</b>. And the purpose is <b class="calibre5">that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love</b>. This purpose will not be completely realized until we are with Him in heaven (1 John 3:2), but the process should be going on continually in our lives down here.</p>

        <p class="sbt"><a class="xref" href="part0002.html#rsb34">DIVINE ELECTION</a></p>
        <p class="sbaft">The doctrine of election raises serious problems in the human mind, so we must consider more fully what the Bible does (and does not) teach on this subject.</p>
        <p class="sb">First, it teaches that God does choose men to salvation (2 Thess. 2:13). It addresses believers as those who are “elect according to the foreknowledge of God” (1 Pet. 1:2). It teaches that people can know whether they are elect by their response to the gospel: those who hear and believe it are elect (1 Thess. 1:4–7).</p>
        <p class="sb">On the other hand, the Bible never teaches that God chooses men to be lost. The fact that He chooses some to be saved does not imply that He arbitrarily condemns all the rest. He never condemns men who deserve to be saved (there are none), but He does save some who ought to be condemned. When Paul describes the elect, he speaks of them as “vessels of mercy which He had prepared beforehand for glory” (Rom. 9:23); but when he turns to the lost, he simply says, “vessels of wrath prepared for destruction” (Rom. 9:22). God prepares vessels of mercy to glory, but He does not prepare men for destruction: they do this for themselves by their own unbelief.</p>
        <p class="sb">The doctrine of election lets God be God. He is sovereign, that is, He can do as He pleases, although He never pleases to do anything unjust. If left alone, all men would be lost. Does God have the right to show mercy to some?</p>
        <p class="sb">But there is another side to the story. The same Bible that teaches sovereign election also teaches human responsibility. No one can use the doctrine of election as an excuse for not being saved. God makes a bona fide offer of salvation to all people everywhere (John 3:16; 3:36; 5:24; Rom. 10:9, 13). Anyone can be saved by repenting of his sins and believing on the Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, if a person is lost, it is because he chooses to be lost, not because God desires it.</p>
        <p class="sb">The fact is that the same Bible teaches election and free salvation to all who will receive it. Both doctrines are found in a single verse: “All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out” (John 6:37). The first half of the verse speaks of God’s sovereign choice; the last half extends the offer of mercy to all.</p>
        <p class="sb">This poses a difficulty for the human mind. How can God choose some and yet offer salvation freely to all men? Frankly, this is a mystery. But the mystery is on our side, not on God’s. The best policy for us is to believe both doctrines because the Bible teaches both. The truth is not found somewhere between election and man’s free will, but in both extremes. W. G. Blaikie summarizes:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <p class="bqs">Divine sovereignty, human responsibility and the free and universal offer of mercy are all found in Scripture, and though we are unable to harmonize them by our logic, they all ought to have a place in our minds.<a id="calibre_link-72" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-32">3</a></p>

      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:5</span> The second spiritual blessing from the treasury of God’s grace is predestination, or foreordination. Though somewhat related to election, it is not the same. Election pictures God’s choice of people to salvation. But predestination is an advance on this: It means that God determined ahead of time that all who would be saved would also be adopted into His family <b class="calibre5">as sons</b>. He could have saved us without making us His sons, but He chose to do both.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Many translations link the last two words of verse 4 with verse 5 as follows: <b class="calibre5">in love having predestined us</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This reminds us of the unique affection that prompted God to deal with us so graciously.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We have the fact of our glorious <b class="calibre5">adoption</b> in the phrase, <b class="calibre5">having predestined us to adoption as sons</b>. In the NT, <b class="calibre5">adoption</b> means placing a believer in the family of God as a mature, adult son with all the privileges and responsibilities of sonship (Gal. 4:4–7). The Spirit of adoption plants within the believer the instinct to address God as Father (Rom. 8:15).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Our <b class="calibre5">adoption as sons</b> is <b class="calibre5">by Jesus Christ</b>. God could never have brought us into this position of nearness and dearness <b class="calibre5">to Himself</b> as long as we were in our sins. So the Lord Jesus came to earth, and by His death, burial, and resurrection He settled the sin question to God’s satisfaction. It is the infinite value of His sacrifice on Calvary that provides a righteous basis on which God can adopt us <b class="calibre5">as sons</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And it is all <b class="calibre5">according to the good pleasure of His will</b>. This is the sovereign motivation behind our predestination. It answers the question, “Why did He do it?” Simply because it was His <b class="calibre5">good pleasure</b>. He could not be satisfied until He had surrounded Himself with sons, conformed to the image of His only begotten Son, with Him and like Him forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:6</span> <b class="calibre5">To the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He has made us accepted in the Beloved.</b> As Paul has contemplated the grace of God first in electing us and then in predestining us to be His sons, he punctuates his meditation with this refrain that is at once an exclamation, an explanation, and an exhortation. It is an <i class="calibre3">exclamation</i>—a holy gasp at the transcendent glories of such grace. It is an <i class="calibre3">explanation</i> that the object and the result of all God’s gracious dealings with us is His own <b class="calibre5">glory</b>. Eternal adoration is due to Him for such matchless favor. Notice the terms of His <b class="calibre5">grace—He</b> (freely) <b class="calibre5">made us accepted</b>. The recipients of His <b class="calibre5">grace—us</b>. The channel of His <b class="calibre5">grace—in the Beloved</b>. Finally, it is an <i class="calibre3">exhortation</i>. Paul is saying, “Let us <b class="calibre5">praise</b> Him for His glorious <b class="calibre5">grace.”</b> Before we go any farther, let us do it!</p>

      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:7</span> As we trace the sublime sweep of God’s eternal plan for His people, we come next to the fact of <b class="calibre5">redemption</b>. This describes that aspect of the work of Christ by which we are freed from the bondage and guilt of sin and introduced into a life of liberty. The Lord Jesus is the Redeemer (<b class="calibre5">In Him we have redemption</b>). We are the redeemed. <b class="calibre5">His blood</b> is the ransom price; nothing less would do.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One of the results of redemption is <b class="calibre5">the forgiveness of sins</b>. <b class="calibre5">Forgiveness</b> is not the same as <b class="calibre5">redemption</b>; it is one of its fruits. Christ had to make full satisfaction for our sins before they could be forgiven. This was done at the cross. And now—</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Stern justice can demand no more</p>
        <p class="sll">And mercy can dispense her store.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The measure of our <b class="calibre5">forgiveness</b> is given in the words <b class="calibre5">according to the riches of His grace</b>. If we can measure <b class="calibre5">the riches of</b> God’s <b class="calibre5">grace</b>, then we can measure how fully He has forgiven us. His <b class="calibre5">grace</b> is infinite! So is His <b class="calibre5">forgiveness</b>!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:8</span> It was in grace that He chose us, predestined us, and redeemed us. But that is not all. God has superabounded that same grace <b class="calibre5">toward us in all wisdom and prudence</b>. This means He has graciously shared His plans and purposes with us. His desire is that we should have intelligence and insight into His plans for the church and for the universe. And so He has taken us into His confidence, as it were, and has revealed to us the great goal toward which all history is moving.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:9</span> Paul now explains the particular way in which God has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, namely, by making <b class="calibre5">known to us the mystery of His will</b>. This is the dominant theme of the Epistle—the glorious truth concerning Christ and the church. It is a <b class="calibre5">mystery</b>, not in the sense that it is mysterious, but that it is a sacred secret previously unknown but now revealed to the saints. This glorious plan originated in the sovereign will of God, quite apart from any outside influences: it was <b class="calibre5">according to His good pleasure</b>. And the grand subject of the plan is the Lord Jesus Christ; this is indicated by the clause <b class="calibre5">which He purposed in Himself.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:10</span> Now Paul begins a more detailed explanation of the secret of God’s plan, and in this chapter he is thinking particularly of the future aspect of the mystery. Chapters 2 and 3 will add further light on the present aspect of the mystery.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The time which Paul has in view is indicated by the expression <b class="calibre5">the dispensation</b> (administration, Gk. <span class="calibre3">oikonomia</span>) <b class="calibre5">of the fullness of the times</b>. We understand this to refer to the Millennium, when Christ will return to the earth to reign as King of kings and Lord of lords. God has a special economy or plan of administration for the final era of human history on this earth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The plan is “to head up all things in the Christ” (JND). During the Millennial Reign, <b class="calibre5">all things in heaven</b> and <b class="calibre5">on earth</b> will be summed up <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>. The Savior who is now rejected and disowned will then be the preeminent One, the Lord of all, the object of universal worship. This is God’s goal—to set up <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> as Head over <b class="calibre5">all things</b>, heavenly and earthly, in the kingdom.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The extent of the dominion of Christ is found in the words, “the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth” (JND). Bellett writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">This is a secret never made known before. In the prophet Isaiah, we get a beautiful picture of the millennial earth; but do we ever get the millennial heavens with Christ at their head? Was it ever said by Isaiah that all things in heaven and earth should be headed up in the glorified Man?<a id="calibre_link-73" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-33">4</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Verse 10 is sometimes used to support the false doctrine of universal salvation. It is twisted to suggest that eventually everything and everyone will be restored and reconciled in Christ. But that is quite foreign to the passage. Paul is speaking about universal <i class="calibre3">dominion</i>, not universal salvation!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:11</span> One vital feature of the mystery is that believing Jews and believing Gentiles have their share in this grand program of God. The apostle speaks of the mystery in relation to Jewish believers in verses 11 and 12; in relation to Gentile believers in verse 13; then he combines them both in verse 14.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As for the Christians of Jewish ancestry, Paul writes, <b class="calibre5">In Him also we have obtained an inheritance</b>. Their right to a share is not based on their former national privileges, but solely on their union with Christ. The <b class="calibre5">inheritance</b> here looks forward to the time when they and all true believers will be manifested to an amazed world as the Body of Christ, the Bride of the Lamb.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">From all eternity these Jewish Christians were marked out for this place of privilege by the sovereign will of God, <b class="calibre5">being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:12</span> The purpose of this predestination was <b class="calibre5">that</b> they <b class="calibre5">should be to the praise of His glory</b>. In other words, they are trophies of the grace of God, exhibiting what He can do with such unlikely raw materials, and thus bringing <b class="calibre5">glory</b> to Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle speaks of himself and other believing Jews as <b class="calibre5">we who first trusted in Christ</b>. He is thinking of the godly remnant of Jews who responded to the gospel in the early days of Christianity. The good news was first preached to the Jews. Most of the nation of Israel flatly rejected it. But the godly remnant believed on the Lord Jesus. Paul was one of that number.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It will be different when the Savior returns to the earth the second time. Then the nation will look on Him whom they pierced and will mourn for Him as for an only Son (Zech. 12:10). “And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: ‘The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob’ ” (Rom. 11:26). Paul and his Christian contemporaries of Jewish background trusted in the Messiah before the rest of the nation. That is why he uses the description “we … who have trusted beforehand in Christ” (FWG).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Those who “fore-hoped” in Messiah will reign with Him over the earth. The rest of the nation will be the earthly subjects of His kingdom.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:13</span> Now Paul switches from believers who had been born Jews to those who had been born Gentiles; he indicates this by changing from “we” to <b class="calibre5">you</b>. Those who have been saved from paganism have a share in the mystery of God’s will, as well as converted Jews. And so the apostle here traces the steps by which the Ephesians and other Gentiles had been brought into union with Christ.</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">They <b class="calibre5">heard</b> the gospel.</li>
        <li class="ul">They <b class="calibre5">believed</b> in Christ.</li>
        <li class="ull">They <b class="calibre5">were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">First they <b class="calibre5">heard the word of truth, the gospel of</b> their <b class="calibre5">salvation</b>. Basically, this refers to the good news of <b class="calibre5">salvation</b> through faith in the Lord Jesus. But in a wider sense it includes all the teachings of Christ and the apostles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Having heard this message, they made a commitment of themselves to Christ by a decisive act of faith. The Lord Jesus is the true object of faith. <b class="calibre5">Salvation</b> is found in Him alone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As soon as they <b class="calibre5">believed</b>, they <b class="calibre5">were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise</b>. This means that every true believer receives the <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> of God as a sign that he belongs to God and that he will be kept safe by God until the time he receives his glorified body. Just as in legal matters a seal indicates ownership and security, so it does in divine affairs. The indwelling Spirit brands us as God’s property (1 Cor. 6:19, 20), and guarantees our preservation until the day of redemption (Eph. 4:30).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Our seal is called <b class="calibre5">the Holy Spirit of promise</b>. First, He is the <i class="calibre3">Holy</i> Spirit; this is what He is in Himself. Then, He is the Spirit of <i class="calibre3">promise</i>. He was promised by the Father (Joel 2:28; Acts 1:4), and by the Lord Jesus (John 16:7). In addition, He is the guarantee that all God’s promises to the believer will be fulfilled.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Verse 13 rounds out the first of many mentions of the Trinity in this Letter:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">God the Father (v. 3)</li>
        <li class="ul">God the Son (v. 7)</li>
        <li class="ull">God the Spirit (v. 13)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:14</span> Again Paul changes his pronouns. He merges the “we” of verses 11 and 12 with the “you” of verse 13 to form the <b class="calibre5">our</b> of verse 14. By this deft literary device, he drops a hint of what he will more fully explain in chapters 2 and 3—the union of believing Jews and believing Gentiles to form a new organism, the church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Holy Spirit is <b class="calibre5">the guarantee of our inheritance</b>. This is a down payment, pledging that the full amount will be paid. It is the same in kind as the full payment, but not the same in amount.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As soon as we are saved, the Holy Spirit begins to reveal to us some of the riches that are ours in Christ. He gives us foretastes of the coming glory. But how can we be sure that we will get the full inheritance some day? The Holy Spirit Himself is the earnest or <b class="calibre5">guarantee.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">As the seal, He guarantees that we ourselves will be kept safely for the inheritance. As the earnest, He guarantees the <b class="calibre5">inheritance</b> will be kept securely for us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Spirit is the <b class="calibre5">guarantee until the redemption of the purchased possession</b>. The <b class="calibre5">guarantee</b> looks forward to the full <b class="calibre5">redemption</b>, just as the firstfruits look forward to the complete harvest. The Spirit’s role as earnest will cease when <b class="calibre5">the purchased possession</b> is redeemed. But what does Paul mean by <b class="calibre5">the purchased possession?</b></p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. He may mean <b class="calibre5">our inheritance</b>. All that God possesses is ours through the Lord Jesus: we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:17; 1 Cor. 3:21–23). The universe itself has been defiled through the entrance of sin, and needs to be reconciled and purified (Col. 1:20; Heb. 9:23). When Christ returns to the earth to reign, this groaning creation will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God (Rom. 8:19–22).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The expression <b class="calibre5">the purchased possession</b> may mean the believer’s body. Our spirits and souls were redeemed when we first believed, but the redemption of our bodies is still future. The fact that we suffer, grow old, and die proves that our bodies have not yet been redeemed. When Christ returns for us (1 Thess. 4:13–18), our bodies will be fashioned anew so they can be conformed to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Then they will be fully and forever redeemed (Rom. 8:23).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. Finally, <b class="calibre5">the purchased possession</b> may refer to the church (1 Pet. 2:9: “His own special people”). In this case, its redemption also looks forward to the Rapture, when Christ will present the church to Himself a glorious church without spot or wrinkle or any such thing (Eph. 5:27). Some believe that in this view, God’s own <b class="calibre5">possession</b> may also include the OT saints.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Whichever view we hold, the ultimate result is the same—<b class="calibre5">to the praise of His glory</b>. God’s marvelous plan for His people will then have reached a glorious consummation, and He will be the object of continual praise. Three times in this chapter Paul has reminded us that the intended goal and inevitable result of all God’s actions is that He should be magnified and glorified.</p>

      <h3 id="calibre_link-121" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-34">C. Paul’s Thanksgiving and Prayers for the Saints (1:15–23)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:15</span> In the preceding passage, extending from verse 3 through verse 14 (a single sentence in Greek!), the apostle has traced the thrilling sweep of God’s program from eternity past to eternity future. He has ranged over some of the most awe-inspiring thoughts that can occupy our minds, thoughts so exalted that Paul now shares with his readers his deep prayer burden for their spiritual enlightenment in such concepts. His great desire for them is that they might appreciate their glorious privileges in Christ and the tremendous power which was required to give Christ to the church as Head over all creation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The introductory <b class="calibre5">Therefore</b> looks back to all that God has done and will yet do for those who are members of the body of Christ, as described in verses 3–14.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">After I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints</b>. It was when he received this information that Paul was assured his readers were possessors of the spiritual blessings just described, and was driven to prayer for them. Their <b class="calibre5">faith in the Lord Jesus</b> brought the miracle of salvation to their lives. Their <b class="calibre5">love for all the saints</b> demonstrated the transforming reality of their conversion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Those Bible scholars who do not think this Letter was written exclusively to the Ephesians point to this verse as evidence. Paul speaks here of having heard of the faith of his readers—as if he had never met them. But he had spent at least three years in Ephesus (Acts 20:31). They therefore conclude the Letter was sent to several local congregations, of which Ephesus was only one.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Fortunately the question does not affect the lessons we can learn from the verse. For instance, we see that the <b class="calibre5">Lord</b> is presented as the true object of faith: <b class="calibre5">your faith in the Lord Jesus</b>. We are not told to believe in a creed, in the church, or in Christians. Saving faith is in the risen, exalted Christ at God’s right hand.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Another lesson for us is the expression <b class="calibre5">your love for</b> all <b class="calibre5">the saints</b>. Our love should not be limited to those of our own area of fellowship, but should flow out to all who have been cleansed by the blood of Christ, to all the household of faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A third lesson is found in the combination of <b class="calibre5">faith</b> and <b class="calibre5">love</b>. Some people say they have faith, but it is hard to find any love in their lives. Others profess great love but are quite indifferent to the necessity of faith in Christ. True Christianity combines sound doctrine and sound living.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:16</span> The faith and love of the believers impelled Paul to praise the Lord for them and to pray for them unceasingly. Scroggie puts it nicely:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Thanksgiving is for the foundation already laid, but intercession is for the superstructure going up. Thanksgiving is for past attainments, but intercession is for future advancements. Thanksgiving is for the actual in their experience, but intercession is for the possible in God’s purpose for them.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:17</span> What a privilege it is to have this glimpse into the prayer life of a man of God. In fact, there are two such glimpses in this Letter—here and in 3:14–21. Here the prayer is for spiritual illumination; there it is for spiritual strength. Here the prayer is addressed to <b class="calibre5">God</b>; there to the Father. But in every case Paul’s prayers were unceasing, specific, and appropriate to the current needs of the people. Here the prayer is addressed to <b class="calibre5">the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory</b>. The expression <b class="calibre5">the Father of glory</b> may mean that God is either:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. the Source or Originator of all glory,</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. the One to whom all glory belongs, or</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. the Father of the Lord Jesus, who is the manifestation of God’s glory.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">The prayer continues that He <b class="calibre5">may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him</b>. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit <b class="calibre5">of wisdom</b> (Isa. 11:2), and of <b class="calibre5">revelation</b> (1 Cor. 2:10). But since every believer is indwelt by Him, Paul cannot be praying that his readers might receive the Person of the Holy Spirit but rather that they might receive a special measure of illumination from Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Revelation</b> deals with the imparting of knowledge; <b class="calibre5">wisdom</b> has to do with the proper use of it in our lives. The apostle is not thinking of knowledge in general but of the specific <b class="calibre5">knowledge</b> (Gk. <span class="calibre3">epignōsis</span>) <b class="calibre5">of Him</b>. He wants the believers to have a deep, spiritual, and experimental <b class="calibre5">knowledge</b> of God—a <b class="calibre5">knowledge</b> that cannot be gained by intellectual ability, but only by the gracious ministry of the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Dale explains:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">These Ephesian Christians had already Divine illumination, or they would not have been Christians at all; but Paul prayed that the Divine Spirit who dwelt in them would make their vision clearer, keener, stronger, that the Divine power and love and greatness might be revealed to them far more fully. And perhaps in these days in which men are making such rapid discoveries in inferior provinces of thought, discoveries so fascinating and so exciting as to rival in interest, even for Christian men, the manifestation of God in Christ, there is exceptional need for the church to pray that God would grant it a <i class="calibre3">“spirit of wisdom and revelation”</i>; if He were to answer that prayer we should no longer be dazzled by the knowledge which relates to “things seen and temporal,” it would be outshone by the transcendent glory of “things unseen and eternal.”<a id="calibre_link-74" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-35">5</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:18</span> We have seen that the source of spiritual illumination is God; the channel is the Holy Spirit; and the supreme subject is the full knowledge of God. Now we come to the organs of enlightenment: <b class="calibre5">the eyes of your hearts</b> (NKJV marg.<a id="calibre_link-75" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-36">6</a>) <b class="calibre5">being enlightened</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This figurative expression teaches us that proper understanding of divine realities is not dependent on our having keen intellects but rather tender <b class="calibre5">hearts</b>. It is a matter of the affections as well as of the mind. God’s revelations are given to those who love Him. This opens up wonderful possibilities for every believer, because though we may not all have high I.Q.s, we can all have loving <b class="calibre5">hearts.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Next Paul specifies the three particular areas of divine knowledge which he desires for the saints:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. <b class="calibre5">the hope of His calling</b></li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. <b class="calibre5">the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints</b></li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The hope of His calling</b> points forward to the future; it means that eventual destiny which He had in mind for us when He called us. It includes the fact that we shall be with Christ and like Him forever. We shall be manifested to the universe as sons of God and reign with Him as His spotless Bride. We hope for this, not in the sense that there is any doubt about it, but rather because it is that aspect of our salvation which is still future and to which we look forward.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints</b> is the second tremendous vastness for believers to explore. Notice the way in which Paul stacks words upon words in order to produce the effect of immensity and grandeur:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ul3f"><b class="calibre5">His inheritance</b></li>
        <li class="ul2"><b class="calibre5">His inheritance in the saints</b></li>
        <li class="ul2"><b class="calibre5">The glory of His inheritance in the saints</b></li>
        <li class="ul3l"><b class="calibre5">The riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">There are two possible ways of understanding this, and both are so meaningful that we present both. According to the first, <b class="calibre5">the saints</b> are <b class="calibre5">His inheritance</b>, and He looks on them as a treasure of incomparable worth. In Titus 2:14 and 1 Peter 2:9, believers are described as “His own special people.” It is certainly an exhibition of unspeakable grace that vile, unworthy sinners, saved through Christ, could ever occupy such a place in the heart of God that He would speak of them as <b class="calibre5">His inheritance</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The other view is that the <b class="calibre5">inheritance</b> means all that <i class="calibre3">we</i> will inherit. In brief, it means the whole universe put under the reign of Christ, and we, His Bride, reigning with Him over it. If we really appreciate the wealth of the glory of all He has in store for us, it will spoil us for the attractions and pleasures of this world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:19</span> Paul’s third petition for the saints is that they might have a deep appreciation of the <b class="calibre5">power</b> which God engages to bring all this to pass: <b class="calibre5">the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">F. B. Meyer says, “It is <i class="calibre3">power</i>. It is <i class="calibre3">His</i> power. It is <i class="calibre3">great</i> power; nothing less would suffice. It is <i class="calibre3">exceeding</i> great power, beyond the furthest cast of thought.”<a id="calibre_link-76" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-37">7</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is the power which God used in our redemption, which He uses in our preservation, and which He will yet use in our glorification. Lewis Sperry Chafer writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Paul wants to impress the believer with the greatness of the power which is engaged to accomplish for him everything that God has purposed according to His work of election, predestination and sovereign adoption.<a id="calibre_link-77" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-38">8</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:20</span> To further emphasize the magnitude of this power, the apostle next describes the greatest exhibition of divine <b class="calibre5">power</b> the world has ever known, namely, the power that <b class="calibre5">raised</b> Christ out <b class="calibre5">from</b> among <b class="calibre5">the dead</b> and enthroned Him at God’s <b class="calibre5">right hand</b>. Perhaps we would think that the creation of the universe was the greatest display of God’s might. Or God’s miraculous deliverance of His people through the Red Sea. But no! The NT teaches that Christ’s resurrection and ascension required the greatest outflow of divine energy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Why was this? It seems that all the hosts of hell were massed to frustrate God’s purposes by keeping Christ in the tomb, or by preventing His ascension once He was raised. But God triumphed over every form of opposition. Christ’s resurrection and glorification were a shattering defeat for Satan and his hosts, and a glorious spectacle of victorious power.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">No one is sufficient to describe such power. So Paul borrows several words from the vocabulary of dynamics in his description of the power which is employed on our behalf: <b class="calibre5">“according to</b> that <i class="calibre3">working</i> <b class="calibre5">of</b> the <i class="calibre3">strength</i> of <b class="calibre5">His</b> <i class="calibre3">might</i> <b class="calibre5">which He</b> <i class="calibre3">energized</i> <b class="calibre5">in Christ when He raised Him from the dead.”</b> The words seem to bend under the weight of the idea. It is hardly necessary for us to distinguish between the different words; it is enough to marvel at the immensity of the power and to worship our God for His omnipotence!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Meyer exclaims:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">A marvelous lift was there! From the grave of mortality to the throne of the eternal God, who only has immortality. From the darkness of the tomb to the insufferable light. From this small world to the center and metropolis of the universe. Open the compasses of your faith to measure this measureless abyss. Then marvel at the power which bore your Lord across it.<a id="calibre_link-78" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-39">9</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">As far as the Scriptures are concerned, the resurrection of Christ was the first such event in human history (1 Cor. 15:23). Others had been raised from the dead, but they died again. The Lord Jesus was the first to rise in the power of an endless life. Following Christ’s resurrection and ascension, God <b class="calibre5">seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places</b>. The <b class="calibre5">right hand</b> of God signifies the place of privilege (Heb. 1:13), power (Matt. 26:64), distinction (Heb. 1:3), delight (Ps. 16:11), and dominion (1 Pet. 3:22).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The location is further described as <b class="calibre5">in the heavenly places</b>. This indicates that the phrase includes the dwelling place of God. That is where the Lord Jesus is today in a literal body of flesh and bones, a glorified body no longer capable of dying. Where He is, we soon shall be.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:21</span> The glorification of our Savior is further described as <b class="calibre5">far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come</b>. The Lord Jesus is superior to every ruler or authority, human or angelic, now and forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the heavenlies there are different ranks of angelic beings, some evil and some good. They have different degrees of power. Some, for instance, might correspond to our human offices of president, governor, mayor, or ward alderman. No matter how great their rule, authority, <b class="calibre5">power</b>, and <b class="calibre5">dominion</b> might be, Christ is <b class="calibre5">far above</b> them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And this is true <b class="calibre5">not only in</b> the <b class="calibre5">age</b> in which we live <b class="calibre5">but also in</b> the coming <b class="calibre5">age</b>, that is, the literal Thousand-Year Reign of Christ on earth. He will then be King over all kings and Lord over all lords. He will be exalted above all created beings; no exception can be named.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:22</span> In addition, God has <b class="calibre5">put all</b> created <b class="calibre5">things under His feet</b>. This signifies universal dominion, not only over men and angels, but over all the rest of His creation, animate and inanimate. The writer of Hebrews reminds us that at the present time we do not see all things put under Him (Heb. 2:8). That is true. Though universal dominion belongs to Christ, He does not exercise it as yet. Men, for instance, still rebel against Him and deny Him or resist Him. But God has decreed that His Son will yet wield the scepter of universal dominion, and it is as certain as if it were a present reality.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What follows is almost incredible. This One whose nail-scarred hand will exercise sovereign authority over all the universe—God has given this glorious One <b class="calibre5">to the church</b>! Here Paul makes a startling revelation concerning the mystery of God’s will; step by step he has been leading up to this climactic announcement. With graphic skill he has been describing the resurrection, glorification, and dominion of Christ. While our hearts are still awestruck at the contemplation of this all-glorious Lord, the apostle says, “It is in His capacity as <b class="calibre5">head over all things</b> that Christ has been given <b class="calibre5">to the church.”</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">If we read this verse carelessly, we might understand it to say that Christ is the Head of <b class="calibre5">the church</b>. While that is true enough, the verse says a lot more. It says that <b class="calibre5">the church</b> is closely associated with Him who has been given universal sway.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In verse 21 we learned that Christ is far above every <i class="calibre3">creature</i> in heaven and on earth, in this age and in the coming age. In the first part of verse 22 we learned that <b class="calibre5">all things</b> as well as all created beings are in subjection <b class="calibre5">under His feet</b>. Now we learn that the unique calling of <b class="calibre5">the church</b> is to be associated with Him in His boundless dominion. <b class="calibre5">The church</b> will share His rule. All the rest of creation will be under His rule.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:23</span> In this final verse of chapter 1, we learn how close is the relationship between Christ and the church. Two figures are given: (1) The church <b class="calibre5">is His body</b>; (2) It is <b class="calibre5">the fullness of Him who fills all in all</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">No relationship could be closer than that of the head and the <b class="calibre5">body</b>. They are one in vital union and indwelt by one Spirit. The church is a company of people called out from the world between Pentecost and the Rapture, saved by marvelous grace, and given the unique privilege of being the <b class="calibre5">body</b> of Christ. No other group of believers in any age ever has had or will have this distinction.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The second description of the church is <b class="calibre5">the fullness of Him who fills all in all</b>. This simply means that the church is the complement of Christ, who is everywhere at one and the same time. A complement is that which fills up or completes. It implies two things which when brought together constitute a whole. Just as a body is the complement of the head, so the church is the complement of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But lest anyone should think this implies any imperfection or incompleteness in Christ, Paul quickly adds, <b class="calibre5">the fullness of Him who fills all in all</b>. Far from His needing anything to fill up any lack of completeness, the Lord Jesus is Himself the One <b class="calibre5">who fills all in all</b>, who permeates the universe and supplies it with all that it needs.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Admittedly, this is too much for us to understand. We can only admire the infinite mind and plan of God while admitting our own inability to comprehend it.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-122" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-40">D. God’s Power Manifest in the Salvation of Gentiles and Jews (2:1–10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:1</span> The chapter break should not obscure the vital connection between the latter part of chapter 1 and the verses that follow. There we watched the mighty power of God as it raised Christ from the grave and crowned Him with glory and honor. Now we see how that same power has worked in our own lives, raising us from spiritual death and seating us in Christ in the heavenlies.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This passage resembles the first chapter of Genesis. In each we have: (1) a scene of desolation, chaos, and ruin (Gen. 1:2a; Eph. 2:1–3); (2) the introduction of divine power (Gen. 1:2b; Eph. 2:4); (3) the creation of new life (Gen. 1:3–31; Eph. 2:5–22).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When Ephesians 2 opens, we are spiritual corpses in death valley. When it closes, we are not only seated in Christ in the heavenlies; we form a habitation of God through the Spirit. In between we have the mighty miracle that brought about this remarkable transformation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first ten verses describe God’s power in the salvation of Gentiles and Jews. No Cinderella ever advanced from such rags to such riches!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In verses 1 and 2 Paul reminds his Gentile readers that before their conversion they <b class="calibre5">were dead</b>, depraved, diabolical, and disobedient. They <b class="calibre5">were</b> spiritually <b class="calibre5">dead</b> as a result of their <b class="calibre5">trespasses and sins</b>. This means they were lifeless toward God. They had no vital contact with Him. They lived as if He did not exist. The cause of death was <b class="calibre5">trespasses and sins</b>. <b class="calibre5">Sins</b> are any form of wrongdoing, whether consciously committed or not, and thoughts, words, or deeds which fall short of God’s perfection. <b class="calibre5">Trespasses</b> are sins which are committed in open violation of a known law. In a wider sense they may also include any form of false steps or blunders.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:2</span> The Ephesians had been depraved as well as dead. They <b class="calibre5">walked according to the course of this world</b>. They conformed to the spirit of this age. They indulged in the sins of the times. The world has a mold into which it pours its devotees. It is a mold of deceit, immorality, ungodliness, selfishness, violence, and rebellion. In a word, it is a mold of depravity. That is what the Ephesians had been like.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only so, their behavior was diabolical. They followed the example of the devil, <b class="calibre5">the prince of the power of the air</b>. They were led around by the chief ruler of evil spirits, whose realm is the atmosphere. They were willingly obedient to the god of this age. This explains why the unconverted often stoop to vile forms of behavior lower than that of animals.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, they were disobedient, walking according to <b class="calibre5">the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience</b>. All unsaved people are <b class="calibre5">sons of disobedience</b> in the sense that they are characterized by <b class="calibre5">disobedience</b> to God. They are energized by Satan and are therefore disposed to defy, dishonor, and disobey the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:3</span> Paul’s switch of the personal pronoun from <i class="calibre3">you</i> to <i class="calibre3">we</i> indicates he is now speaking primarily of Jewish believers (although what he says is also true of everyone before conversion). Three words describe their status: carnal, corrupt, and condemned.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh</b>. It was among the sons of disobedience that Paul and his fellow Christians also walked prior to their new birth. Their life was <i class="calibre3">carnal</i>, concerned only with the gratification of fleshly desires and appetites. Paul himself had lived an outwardly moral life on the whole, but now he realized how self-centered it was. And what he was in himself was a lot worse than anything he had ever done.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The unconverted Jews were also <i class="calibre3">corrupt</i>, <b class="calibre5">fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind</b>. This indicates an abandonment to every natural desire. <b class="calibre5">Desires of the flesh and of the mind</b> may range all the way from legitimate appetites to various forms of immorality and perversion; here the emphasis is probably on the grosser sins. And notice, Paul refers to sins of thought as well as to sinful acts.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">F. B. Meyer warns:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">It is as ruinous to indulge the desires of the <b class="calibre5">mind</b> as those of the <b class="calibre5">flesh</b>. By the marvelous gift of imagination we may indulge unholy fancies, and throw the reins on the neck of the steeds of passion—always stopping short of the act. No human eye follows the soul when it goes forth to dance with satyrs or to thread the labyrinthine maze of the islands of desire. It goes and returns unsuspected by the nearest. Its credit for snow-white purity is not forfeited. It is still permitted to watch among the virgins for the Bridegroom’s advent. But if this practice is unjudged and unconfessed, it marks the offender a son of disobedience and a child of wrath.<a id="calibre_link-79" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-41">10</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">This is Paul’s final description of the unsaved Jews: they were <b class="calibre5">by nature children of wrath, just as the others</b>. This means they had a natural predisposition to anger, malice, bitterness, and hot temper. They shared this with the rest of mankind. Of course, it is also true that they are under the <b class="calibre5">wrath</b> of God. They are appointed to death and judgment. Notice that man’s three enemies are mentioned in verses 2 and 3: the world (v. 2), the devil (v. 2), and the flesh (v. 3).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:4</span> The words <b class="calibre5">But God</b> form one of the most significant, eloquent, and inspiring transitions in all literature. They indicate that a stupendous change has taken place. It is a change from the doom and despair of the valley of death to the unspeakable delights of the kingdom of the Son of God’s love.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Author of the change is <b class="calibre5">God</b> Himself. No one else <i class="calibre3">could</i> have done it, and no one else <i class="calibre3">would</i> have done it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One characteristic of this blessed One is that He <b class="calibre5">is rich in mercy</b>. He shows <b class="calibre5">mercy</b> to us by not treating us the way we deserve to be treated (Ps. 103:10). “Though it has been expended by Him for six millennia, and myriads and myriads have been partakers of it, it is still an unexhausted mine of wealth,” as Eadie remarks.<a id="calibre_link-80" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-42">11</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The reason for His intervention is given in the words <b class="calibre5">because of His great love with which He loved us</b>. His love is great because He is its source. Just as the greatness of a giver casts an aura of greatness on his gift, so the surpassing excellence of God adds superlative luster to His love. It is greater to be loved by the mighty Sovereign of the universe, for instance, than by a fellow human being. God’s love is great because of the price He paid. Love sent the Lord Jesus, God’s only begotten Son, to die for us in agony at Calvary. God’s love is great because of the unsearchable riches it showers on its objects.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:5</span> And God’s love is great because of the extreme unworthiness and unloveliness of the persons loved. <b class="calibre5">We were dead in trespasses</b>. We were enemies of God. We were destitute and degraded. He loved us in spite of it all.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As a result of God’s love for us, and as a result of the redeeming work of Christ, we have been: (1) <b class="calibre5">made alive together with Christ</b>; (2) raised up with Him; (3) seated in Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These expressions describe our spiritual position as a result of our union with Him. He acted as our Representative—not only <i class="calibre3">for</i> us, but <i class="calibre3">as</i> us. Therefore when He died, we died. When He was buried, we were buried.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When <i class="calibre3">He</i> was <b class="calibre5">made alive</b>, raised, and seated in the heavenlies, so were <i class="calibre3">we</i>. All the benefits of His sacrificial work are enjoyed by us because of our link with Him. To be <b class="calibre5">made alive together with</b> Him means that converted Jews and converted Gentiles are now associated with Him in newness of life. The same power that gave Him resurrection life has given it to us also.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The marvel of this causes Paul to interrupt his train of thought and exclaim, <b class="calibre5">By grace you have been saved</b>. He is overwhelmed by the fathomless favor which God has shown to those who deserved the very opposite. That is <b class="calibre5">grace</b>!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We have already mentioned that mercy means we do not get the punishment we deserve. <b class="calibre5">Grace</b> means we <i class="calibre3">do</i> get the salvation we do <i class="calibre3">not</i> deserve. We get it as a gift, not as something we earn. And it comes from One who was not compelled to give it. A. T. Pierson says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">It is a voluntary exercise of love for which He is under no obligation. What constituted the glory of grace is that it is an utterly unfettered, unconstrained exercise of the love of God toward poor sinners.<a id="calibre_link-81" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-43">12</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:6</span> Not only have we been made alive with Christ; we have also been <b class="calibre5">raised up</b> with Him. Just as death and judgment are behind Him, they are behind us also. We stand on the resurrection side of the tomb. This is our glorious position as a result of our union with Him. And because it is true of us positionally, we should live as those who are alive from the dead.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Another aspect of our position is that we are seated in Him <b class="calibre5">in the heavenly places in Christ</b>. By our union with Him we are seen as already delivered from this present evil world and seated <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b> in glory. This is how God sees us. If we appropriate it by faith, it will change the character of our lives. We will no longer be earthbound, occupied with the trivial and the transient. We will seek those things which are above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God (Col. 3:1).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The key to verses 5 and 6 is the phrase, <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>. It is in Him that we have been made alive, raised, and seated. He is our Representative; therefore His triumphs and His position are ours. George Williams exclaims, “Amazing thought! That a Mary Magdalene and a crucified thief should be the companions in glory of the Son of God.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:7</span> This miracle of transforming grace will be the subject of eternal revelation. Throughout the endless ages God will be unveiling to the heavenly throng what it cost Him to send His Son to this jungle of sin, and what it cost the Lord Jesus to bear our sins at the cross. It is a subject that will never be exhausted. Again Paul builds words upon words to suggest something of its immensity:</p>

      <p class="calibre2">Now it follows that if God will be disclosing this throughout eternity, then we will be learning forever and ever. Heaven will be our school. God will be the Teacher. <b class="calibre5">His grace</b> will be the subject. We will be the students. And the school term will be eternity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This should deliver us from the idea that we will know everything when we get to heaven. Only God knows everything, and we will never be equal with Him.<a id="calibre_link-82" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-44">13</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">It also raises the interesting question: How much will we know when we get to heaven? And it suggests the possibility that we can prepare for the heavenly university by majoring in the Bible right now.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:8</span> The next three verses present as clear a statement of the simple plan of salvation as we can find in the Bible.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It all originates with the <b class="calibre5">grace</b> of God: He takes the initiative in providing it. Salvation is given to those who are utterly unworthy of it, on the basis of the Person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is given as a present possession. Those who are saved can know it. Writing to the Ephesians, Paul said, <b class="calibre5">You have been saved</b>. He knew it, and they knew it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The way we receive the gift of eternal life is <b class="calibre5">through faith</b>. <b class="calibre5">Faith</b> means that man takes his place as a lost, guilty sinner, and receives the Lord Jesus as his only hope of salvation. True saving faith is the commitment of a person to a Person.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Any idea that man can earn or deserve salvation is forever exploded by the words <b class="calibre5">and that not of yourselves</b>. Dead people can <i class="calibre3">do</i> nothing, and sinners <i class="calibre3">deserve</i> nothing but punishment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">It is the gift of God</b>. A gift, of course, is a free and unconditional present. That is the only basis on which God offers salvation. <b class="calibre5">The gift of God</b> is <i class="calibre3">salvation</i> <b class="calibre5">by grace</b> and <b class="calibre5">through faith</b>. It is offered to all people everywhere.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:9</span> It is <b class="calibre5">not of works</b>, that is, it is not something a person can earn through supposedly meritorious deeds. It cannot be earned, for instance, by:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Confirmation</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Baptism</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. Church membership</li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. Church attendance</li>
        <li class="ul" value="5">5. Holy Communion</li>
        <li class="ul" value="6">6. Trying to keep the Ten Commandments</li>
        <li class="ul" value="7">7. Living by the Sermon on the Mount</li>
        <li class="ul" value="8">8. Giving to charity</li>
        <li class="ul" value="9">9. Being a good neighbor</li>
        <li class="ull" value="10">10. Living a moral, respectable life</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">People are not saved by <b class="calibre5">works</b>. And they are <i class="calibre3">not</i> saved by faith <i class="calibre3">plus</i> <b class="calibre5">works</b>. They are <b class="calibre5">saved through faith</b> <i class="calibre3">alone</i>. The minute you add works of any kind or in any amount as a means of gaining eternal life, salvation is no longer by grace (Rom. 11:6). One reason that <b class="calibre5">works</b> are positively excluded is to prevent human boasting. If anyone could be saved by his <b class="calibre5">works</b>, then he would have reason to <b class="calibre5">boast</b> before God. This is impossible (Rom. 3:27).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If anyone could be saved by his own good works, then the death of Christ was unnecessary (Gal. 2:21). But we know that the reason He died was because there was no other way by which guilty sinners could be saved.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If anyone could be saved by his own good works, then he would be his own savior, and could worship himself. But this would be idolatry, and God forbids it (Ex. 20:3).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Even if someone could be saved through faith in Christ plus his own good works, you would have the impossible situation of two saviors—Jesus and the sinner. Christ would then have to share the glory of saviorhood with another, and this He will not do (Isa. 42:8).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, if anyone could contribute to his salvation by works, then God would owe it to him. This, too, is impossible. God cannot be indebted to anyone (Rom. 11:35).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In contrast to works, faith excludes boasting (Rom. 3:27), because it is non-meritorious. A man has no reason to be proud that he has trusted the Lord. Faith in Him is the most sane, rational, sensible thing a person can do. To trust one’s Creator and Redeemer is only logical and reasonable. If we cannot trust Him, whom can we trust?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:10</span> The result of salvation is that <b class="calibre5">we are His workmanship</b>—the handiwork of God, not of ourselves. A born-again believer is a masterpiece of God. When we think of the raw materials He has to work with, His achievement is all the more remarkable. Indeed, this masterpiece is nothing less than a new creation through union with Christ, for “if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And the object of this new creation is found in the phrase <b class="calibre5">for good works</b>. While it is true that we are not saved <i class="calibre3">by</i> <b class="calibre5">good works</b>, it is equally true that we are saved <b class="calibre5">for</b> good works. <b class="calibre5">Good works</b> are not the <i class="calibre3">root</i> but the <i class="calibre3">fruit</i>. We do not work <i class="calibre3">in order to be saved</i>, but <i class="calibre3">because we are saved</i>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is the aspect of the truth that is emphasized in James 2:14–26. When James says that “faith without works is dead,” he does not mean we are saved by faith plus works, but by the kind of faith that results in a life of <b class="calibre5">good works</b>. <b class="calibre5">Works</b> prove the reality of our faith. Paul heartily agrees: <b class="calibre5">we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">God’s order then is this:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs"><b class="calibre5">Faith</b> <span>→</span> <b class="calibre5">Salvation</b> <span>→</span> <b class="calibre5">Good Works</b> <span>→</span> <b class="calibre5">Reward</b></p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft">Faith leads to salvation. Salvation results in <b class="calibre5">good works</b>. Good works will be rewarded by Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But the question arises: What kind of <b class="calibre5">good works</b> am I expected to do? Paul answers, <b class="calibre5">Good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them</b>. In other words, God has a blueprint for every life. Before our conversion He mapped out a spiritual career for us. Our responsibility is to find His will for us and then obey it. We do not have to work out a plan for our lives, but only accept the plan which He has drawn up for us. This delivers us from fret and frenzy, and insures that our lives will be of maximum glory to Him, of most blessing to others, and of greatest reward to ourselves.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In order to find out the <b class="calibre5">good works</b> He has planned for our individual lives, we should: (1) confess and forsake sin as soon as we are conscious of it in our lives; (2) be continually and unconditionally yielded to Him; (3) study the word of God to discern His will, and then do whatever He tells us to do; (4) spend time in prayer each day; (5) seize opportunities of service as they arise; (6) cultivate the fellowship and counsel of other Christians. God prepares us <b class="calibre5">for good works</b>. He prepares <b class="calibre5">good works</b> for us to perform. Then He rewards us when we perform them. Such is His grace!</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-123" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-45">E. The Union of Believing Jews and Gentiles in Christ (2:11–22)</a></h3>
      <p class="calibre2">In the first half of chapter 2 Paul traced the salvation of individual Gentiles and Jews. Now he advances to the abolition of their former national differences, to their union in Christ, and to their formation into the church, a holy temple in the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:11</span> In verses 11 and 12 the apostle reminds his readers that prior to their conversion they were <b class="calibre5">Gentiles</b> by birth and therefore outcasts as far as the Jews were concerned. First, they were despised. This is indicated by the fact that the Jews called them <b class="calibre5">Uncircumcision</b>. This meant the Gentiles did not have the surgical sign in their flesh that marked the Israelites as God’s covenant people. The name “uncircumcised” was an ethnic slur, similar to the names that people use today for despised nationalities. We can feel something of its sting when we hear David say concerning the Gentile Goliath, “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” (1 Sam. 17:26).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Jews, by contrast, spoke of themselves as <b class="calibre5">the Circumcision</b>. This was a name of which they were proud. It identified them as God’s chosen earthly people, set apart from all the other nations of the earth. Paul seems to take exception to some of their boasting by saying their circumcision was only <b class="calibre5">made in the flesh by hands</b>. It was merely physical. Though they had the outward sign of God’s covenant people, they did not have the inward reality of true faith in the Lord. “For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the Spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men but from God” (Rom. 2:28, 29).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But whether or not the Jews were circumcised in heart, the point in verse 11 is that in their own eyes they were <i class="calibre3">the</i> people and the Gentiles were despised. This enmity between Jews and Gentiles was the greatest racial and religious difference the world has ever known. The Jew enjoyed a position of great privilege before God (Rom. 9:4, 5). The Gentile was a foreigner. If he wanted to worship the true God in the appointed way, he actually had to become a Jewish convert (cf. Rahab and Ruth). The Jewish temple in Jerusalem was the only place on earth where God had placed His name and where men could approach Him. Gentiles were forbidden to enter the inner temple courts on pain of death.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In His interview with a Gentile woman from the region of Tyre and Sidon, the Lord Jesus tested her faith by picturing the Jews as children in the house and the Gentiles as little dogs under the table. She acknowledged she was only a little dog, but asked for some crumbs the children might drop. Needless to say, her faith was rewarded (Mark 7:24–30). Here in Ephesians 2:11 the apostle is reminding his readers that they were formerly Gentiles and therefore despised.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:12</span> The Gentiles were also <b class="calibre5">without Christ</b>: They had no Messiah. It was to the nation of Israel that He was promised. Although it was predicted that blessing would flow to the nations through the ministry of the Messiah (Isa. 11:10; 60:3), yet He was to be born a Jew and to minister primarily “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel” (Matt. 15:24). In addition to being without the Messiah, the Gentiles were <b class="calibre5">aliens from the commonwealth of Israel</b>. An alien is one who does not “belong.” He is a stranger and foreigner, without the rights and privileges of citizenship. As far as the community of <b class="calibre5">Israel</b> was concerned, the Gentiles were on the outside, looking in. And they were <b class="calibre5">strangers from the covenants of promise</b>. God had made <b class="calibre5">covenants</b> with the nation of <b class="calibre5">Israel</b> through such men as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon. These <b class="calibre5">covenants</b> promised blessings to the Jews. For all practical purposes, the Gentiles were outside the pale. They were without <b class="calibre5">hope</b>, both nationally and individually. Nationally, they had no assurance that their land, their government, or their people would survive. And individually their outlook was bleak: they had <b class="calibre5">no hope</b> beyond the grave. Someone has said that their future was a night without a star. Finally, they were <b class="calibre5">without God in the world</b>. This does not mean they were atheists. They had their own gods of wood and stone, and worshiped them. But they did not know the one and only true God. They were God-less in a godless, hostile world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:13</span> The words <b class="calibre5">But now</b> signal another abrupt transition (cf. 2:4). The Ephesian Gentiles had been rescued from that place of distance and alienation, and had been elevated to a position of nearness to God. This was brought about at the time of their conversion. When they trusted the Savior, God placed them <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b> and accepted them in the beloved One. From then on they were as <b class="calibre5">near</b> to God as Christ is, because they were <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>. The cost of effecting this marvelous change was <b class="calibre5">the blood of Christ</b>. Before these Gentile sinners could enjoy the privilege of nearness to God, they had to be cleansed from their sins. Only <b class="calibre5">the blood of Christ</b> shed at Calvary could do this. When they received the Lord Jesus by a definite act of faith, all the cleansing value of His precious blood was credited to their account.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Jesus not only <b class="calibre5">brought</b> them <b class="calibre5">near</b>; He also created a new society in which the ancient enmity between Jew and Gentile was forever abolished. Up to NT times, all the world was divided into two classes—Jew and Gentile. Our Savior has introduced a third—the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32). In the verses that follow, we see how believing Jews and believing Gentiles are now made one in Christ, and are introduced into this new society, where there is neither Jew nor Gentile.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:14</span> <b class="calibre5">For He Himself is our peace</b>. Notice it does not say, “He made peace.” That, of course, is true too, as we will see in the next verse. Here the fact is that <b class="calibre5">He Himself</b> <span class="bi">is</span> <b class="calibre5">our peace</b>. But how can a person <i class="calibre3">be</i> peace?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is how: When a Jew believes on the Lord Jesus, he loses his national identity; from then on he is “in Christ.” Likewise, when a Gentile receives the Savior, he is no longer a Gentile; henceforth he is “in Christ.” In other words, believing Jew and believing Gentile, once divided by enmity, are now <b class="calibre5">both one</b> in Christ. Their union with Christ necessarily unites them with one another. Therefore a Man <b class="calibre5">is</b> the <b class="calibre5">peace</b>, just as Micah predicted (Mic. 5:5).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The scope of His work as <b class="calibre5">our peace</b> is detailed in verses 14–18.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First is the work of union which we have just described. He <b class="calibre5">has made both one</b>—that is, both believing Jews and Gentiles. They are no longer Jews or Gentiles, but Christians. Strictly speaking, it is not accurate even to speak of them as Jewish Christians or Gentile Christians. All fleshly distinctions, such as nationality, were nailed to the cross.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The second phase of Christ’s work might be called demolition: <b class="calibre5">He … has broken down the middle wall of separation</b>. Not a literal wall, of course, but the invisible barrier set up by the Mosaic Law of commandments contained in ordinances which separated the people of Israel from the nations. This has often been illustrated by the wall which restricted non-Jews to the Court of the Gentiles in the temple area. On the wall were No Trespassing signs which read: “Let no one of any other nation come within the fence and barrier around the Holy Place. Whoever is caught doing so will himself be responsible for the fact that his death will ensue.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:15</span> A third aspect of Christ’s work was abolition of <b class="calibre5">the enmity</b> that smoldered between Jew and Gentile and also between man and God. Paul identifies the law as the innocent cause of the enmity, that is, <b class="calibre5">the law of commandments contained in ordinances</b>. The Law of Moses was a single legislative code; yet it was made up of separate, formal commandments; these in turn consisted of dogmas or decrees covering many, if not most, areas of life. The law itself was holy, just, and good (Rom. 7:12), but man’s sinful nature used the law as an occasion for hatred. Because the law actually did set up Israel as God’s chosen earthly people, many Jews became arrogant and treated the Gentiles with contempt. The Gentiles struck back with deep hostility, which we have come to know all too well as anti-Semitism. But how did Christ remove the law as the cause of <b class="calibre5">enmity</b>? First, He died to pay the penalty of the law that had been broken. He thus completely satisfied the righteous claims of God. Now the law has nothing more to say to those who are “in Christ”; the penalty has been paid for them in full. Believers are not under law but under grace. However, this does not mean they can live as they please; it means they are now enlawed to Christ, and should live as <i class="calibre3">He</i> pleases.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As a result of abolishing the hostility stirred up by the law, the Lord has been able to usher in a new creation. He has made in Himself <b class="calibre5">from the two</b>, that is, from believing Jew and believing Gentile, <b class="calibre5">one new man</b>—the church. Through union with Him, the former combatants are united with one another in this <b class="calibre5">new</b> fellowship. The church is <b class="calibre5">new</b> in the sense that it is a kind of organism that never existed before. It is important to see this. The NT church is not a continuation of the Israel of the OT. It is something entirely distinct from anything that has preceded it or that will ever follow it. This should be apparent from the following:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. It is <b class="calibre5">new</b> that a Gentile should have equal rights and privileges with a Jew.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. It is <b class="calibre5">new</b> that both Jews and Gentiles should lose their national identities by becoming Christians.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. It is <b class="calibre5">new</b> that Jews and Gentiles should be fellow members of the Body of Christ.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. It is <b class="calibre5">new</b> that a Jew should have the hope of reigning with Christ instead of being a subject in His kingdom.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="5">5. It is <b class="calibre5">new</b> that a Jew should no longer be under the law.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">The church is clearly a <b class="calibre5">new</b> creation, with a distinct calling and a distinct destiny, occupying a unique place in the purposes of God. But the scope of Christ’s work does not stop there. He has also made <b class="calibre5">peace</b> between Jew and Gentile. He did this by removing the cause of hostility, by imparting a new nature, and by creating a new union. The cross is God’s answer to racial discrimination, segregation, anti-Semitism, bigotry, and every form of strife between men.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:16</span> In addition to reconciling Jew and Gentile to one another, Christ has reconciled <b class="calibre5">them both to God</b>. Though Israel and the nations were normally bitterly opposed to each other, there was one sense in which they were united—in their hostility to God. The cause of this hostility was sin. By His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus removed <b class="calibre5">the enmity</b> by removing the cause. Those who receive Him are reckoned righteous, forgiven, redeemed, pardoned, and delivered from the power of sin. The enmity is gone; now they have peace with <b class="calibre5">God</b>. The Lord Jesus unites believing Jew and Gentile <b class="calibre5">in one body</b>, the church, and presents this Body to <b class="calibre5">God</b> with all trace of antagonism gone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">God never needed to be reconciled to us; He never hated us. But we needed to be reconciled to Him. The work of our Lord on the cross provided a righteous basis on which we could be brought into His presence as friends, not as foes.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:17</span> In verse 14 Christ <i class="calibre3">is</i> our peace. In verse 15 He <i class="calibre3">made</i> peace. Now we find that <b class="calibre5">He came and</b> <span class="bi">preached</span> <b class="calibre5">peace</b>. When and how did He come? First, He came personally in resurrection. Second, He came representatively by the Holy Spirit. He <b class="calibre5">preached peace</b> in resurrection; in fact, <b class="calibre5">peace</b> was one of the first words He spoke after rising from the dead (Luke 24:36; John 20:19, 21, 26). Then He sent out the apostles in the power of the Holy Spirit and <b class="calibre5">preached peace</b> through them (Acts 10:36). The good news of <b class="calibre5">peace</b> was presented to <b class="calibre5">you who were afar off</b> (Gentiles) <b class="calibre5">and to those who were near</b> (Jews), a gracious fulfillment of God’s promise in Isaiah 57:19.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:18</span> The practical proof that a state of peace now exists between members of the one Body and God is that they <b class="calibre5">have access</b> at any time into the presence of God. This is in sharp contrast to the OT economy, in which only the high priest could go into the Holy of Holies, the place of God’s presence. And he could enter there on only one day of the year. Eadie points up the contrast:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">But now the most distant Gentile who is in Christ really and continuously enjoys that august spiritual privilege, which the one man of the one tribe of the one nation on the one day of the year, only typically and periodically possessed.<a id="calibre_link-83" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-46">14</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Through prayer any believer can enter the throne room of heaven, kneel before the Sovereign of the universe, and address Him as <b class="calibre5">Father</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The normal order to be followed in prayer is given here. First, it is <b class="calibre5">through Him</b> (the Lord Jesus). He is the one Mediator between God and man. His death, burial, and resurrection removed every legal obstacle to our admission to God’s presence. Now as Mediator he lives on high to maintain us in a condition of fellowship with the Father. We approach God in His name; we have no worthiness of our own, so we plead His worthiness. The participants in prayer are <b class="calibre5">we both</b>—believing Jews and believing Gentiles. The privilege is that we <b class="calibre5">have access</b>. Our Helper in prayer is the Holy Spirit—<b class="calibre5">by one Spirit</b>. “The Spirit helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered” (Rom. 8:26).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The One we approach is <b class="calibre5">the Father</b>. No OT saint ever knew God as Father. Before the resurrection of Christ, men stood before God as creatures before the Creator. It was after He rose that He said, “Go to my brethren and say to them, ‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God’ ” (John 20:17). As a result of His redemptive work, believers were then able for the first time to address God as <b class="calibre5">Father</b>. In verse 18 all three Persons of the Trinity are directly involved in the prayers of the humblest believer: He prays to God the <b class="calibre5">Father</b>, approaching Him <b class="calibre5">through</b> the Lord Jesus Christ, in the power of the Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:19</span> In the last four verses of this chapter, the Apostle Paul lists some of the overwhelming new privileges of believing Gentiles. They <b class="calibre5">are no longer strangers and foreigners</b>. Never again will they be aliens, dogs, uncircumcision, outsiders. Now they are <b class="calibre5">fellow citizens with</b> all <b class="calibre5">the saints</b> of the NT period. Believers of Jewish ancestry have no advantage over them. All Christians are first-class citizens of heaven (Phil. 3:20, 21). They are also <b class="calibre5">members of the household of God</b>. Not only have they been “super-naturalized” into the divine kingdom; they have been adopted into the divine family.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:20</span> Finally, they have been made members of the church, or as Paul pictures it here, they have become stones in the construction of a holy temple. With great detail the apostle describes this temple—its <b class="calibre5">foundation</b>, its <b class="calibre5">chief cornerstone</b>, its cohesive agent, its unity and symmetry, its growth, and its other unique features.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This temple is <i class="calibre3">built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets</i>. This refers to <b class="calibre5">the apostles and prophets</b> of the NT era; it could not possibly refer to OT prophets, because they knew nothing about the church. It does not mean that <b class="calibre5">the apostles and prophets</b> <i class="calibre3">were</i> the foundation of the church. Christ is <b class="calibre5">the foundation</b> (1 Cor. 3:11). But they laid the foundation in what they taught about the Person and work of the Lord Jesus. The church is founded on Christ as He was revealed by the confession and teaching of <b class="calibre5">the apostles and prophets</b>. When Peter confessed Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God, Jesus announced that His church would be built on that rock, namely, on the solid truth that He is the anointed of God and God’s unique Son (Matt. 16:18). In Revelation 21:14 the apostles are associated with the twelve foundations of the holy Jerusalem. They are not the foundation but are linked with it, because they first taught the great truth concerning Christ and the church. The <b class="calibre5">foundation</b> of a building needs to be laid only once. <b class="calibre5">The apostles and prophets</b> did this work once for all. <b class="calibre5">The foundation</b> they laid is preserved for us in the writings of the NT, though they themselves are with us no longer. In a secondary sense, there are men in all ages whose ministry is apostolic or prophetic. Missionaries and church planters are apostles in a lower sense, and those who preach the word for edification are prophets. But they are not apostles and prophets in the primary sense.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Jesus Christ</b> is not only <b class="calibre5">the foundation</b> of the temple; He is its <b class="calibre5">chief cornerstone</b> as well. No one picture or type can adequately portray Him in His manifold glories or in His varied ministries. There are at least three possible explanations of <b class="calibre5">the chief cornerstone</b>, all of which point to the Lord Jesus Christ as the unique, preeminent, and indispensable Head of the church.</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. We generally think of <b class="calibre5">the cornerstone</b> as one that lies at a lower front corner of a building. Since the rest of the structure seems to be supported by it, it has come to signify something of fundamental importance. In that sense it is a true type of the Lord. Also, since it joins two walls together, there may be a suggestion of the union of believing Jews and Gentiles in the church through Him.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Some Bible scholars believe that the word translated <b class="calibre5">the chief cornerstone</b> refers to the keystone of an arch. This stone occupies the highest place in the arch and provides support for the other stones. So Christ is the preeminent One in the church. He is also the indispensable One: remove Him and the rest will collapse.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. A third possible understanding of the term is that it is the capstone of a pyramid. This stone occupies the highest place in the structure. It is the only stone of that size and shape. And its angles and lines determine the shape of the whole pyramid. So Christ is the Head of the church. He is unique as to His Person and ministry. And He is the One who gives the church its unique features. First, its <b class="calibre5">foundation</b>:</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:21</span> The words <b class="calibre5">in whom</b> refer to Christ: He is the source of the church’s life and growth. Blaikie says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">In him we are added to it; in him we grow in it; in him the whole temple grows towards the final consummation, when the <b class="calibre5">topstone</b> shall be brought out with shouts of “Grace, grace unto it.”<a id="calibre_link-84" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-47">15</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The unity and symmetry of the <b class="calibre5">temple</b> are indicated by the expression <b class="calibre5">the whole building, being fitted together</b>. It is a unity made up of many individual members. Each member has a specific place in the <b class="calibre5">building</b> for which he or she is exactly suited. Stones excavated from the valley of death by the grace of God are found to fit together perfectly. The unique feature of this building is that it <b class="calibre5">grows</b>. However, this feature is not the same as the growth of a building through the addition of bricks and cement. Think of it rather as the growth of a living organism, such as the human body. After all, the church is not an inanimate building. Neither is it an organization. It is a living entity with Christ as its Head and all believers forming the Body. It was born on the day of Pentecost, has been growing ever since, and will continue to grow until the Rapture.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This growing building of living materials is described as <b class="calibre5">a holy temple in the Lord</b>. The word Paul used for <b class="calibre5">temple</b> referred not to the outer courts but to the inner shrine (Gk. <span class="calibre3">naos</span>), not the suburbs but the sanctuary. He was thinking of the main building of the temple complex, which housed the Most Holy Place. There God dwelt and there He manifested Himself in a bright, shining cloud of glory.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are several lessons for us here: (1) God indwells the church. Saved Jews and Gentiles form a living sanctuary in which He dwells and where He reveals His glory. (2) This <b class="calibre5">temple</b> is <b class="calibre5">holy</b>. It is set apart from the world and dedicated to Him for sacred purposes. (3) As <b class="calibre5">a holy temple</b>, the church is a center from which praise, worship, and adoration ascend to God through the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul further describes this <b class="calibre5">holy temple</b> as being <b class="calibre5">in the Lord</b>. In other words, the Lord Jesus is its source of holiness. Its members are <b class="calibre5">holy</b> positionally through union with Him, and they should be <b class="calibre5">holy</b> practically out of love for Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:22</span> In this wonderful temple, believing Gentiles have an equal place with believing Jews. It should thrill us to read this, as it must have thrilled the Ephesians and others when they heard it for the first time. The tremendous dignity of the believers’ position is that they form <b class="calibre5">a dwelling place of God in the Spirit</b>. This is the purpose of the temple—to provide a place where <b class="calibre5">God</b> can live in fellowship with His people. The church is that place. Compare this with the position of the Gentiles in the OT. At that time they could not get near God’s dwelling. Now they themselves <i class="calibre3">form</i> a good part of it!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And notice the ministry of each of the Persons of the Godhead in connection with the church: (1) <b class="calibre5">In whom</b>, that is, in Christ. It is through union with Him that we are built into the temple. (2) <b class="calibre5">A dwelling place of God</b>. This temple is the home of God the Father on earth. (3) <b class="calibre5">In the Spirit</b>. It is in the Person of the Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> that <b class="calibre5">God</b> indwells the church (1 Cor. 3:16).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And so the chapter that began with a description of Gentiles who were dead, depraved, diabolical, and disobedient, closes with those same Gentiles cleansed from all guilt and defilement, and forming <b class="calibre5">a dwelling place of God in the Spirit!</b></p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-124" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-48">F. A Parenthesis on the Mystery (3:1–13)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:1</span> Paul begins a statement in verse 1 that is interrupted in verse 2 and not resumed till verse 14. The intervening verses form a parenthesis, the theme of which is the mystery—Christ and the church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What makes this of special interest is that this present Church Age is itself a parenthesis in God’s dealings. This can be explained as follows: During most of the period of history recorded in the OT, God was dealing primarily with the Jewish people. In fact, from Genesis 12 through Malachi 4 the narrative centers almost exclusively on Abraham and his descendants. When the Lord Jesus came to earth, He was rejected by Israel. As a result, God set aside that nation temporarily as His chosen, earthly people. We are now living in the Church Age, when Jews and Gentiles are on the same level before God. After the church has been completed and is taken home to heaven, God will resume His program with Israel nationally. The hands on the prophetic clock will begin to move once more. So the present age is sort of a parenthesis between God’s past and future dealings with Israel. It is a new administration in the divine program—unique and separate from anything before or after it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In verses 2–13 Paul gives a fairly detailed explanation of this parenthesis. Is it an undesigned coincidence that in doing so he uses a literary parenthesis to explain a dispensational parenthesis?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle opens the section, <b class="calibre5">For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles</b>. The phrase <b class="calibre5">For this reason</b> looks back to what he had just been saying about the place of privilege into which believing Gentiles are brought as a result of their union with Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is generally believed that this Letter was written during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment. But he does not speak of himself as a prisoner of Rome. That might have indicated a sense of defeat, a feeling of self-pity, or a craving for sympathy. Paul calls himself <b class="calibre5">the prisoner of Christ Jesus</b>; this speaks of acceptance and dignity and triumph. Ruth Paxson puts it well:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">There is no smell of prison in Ephesians, for Paul is not bound in spirit. He is there as the prisoner of Rome, but this he will not admit, and claims to be the prisoner of Jesus Christ. What is the secret of such victorious other-worldliness? Paul’s spirit is with Christ in the heavenlies, though his body languishes in prison.<a id="calibre_link-85" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-49">16</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">His imprisonment was definitely on behalf of <b class="calibre5">the Gentiles</b>. Throughout his ministry he ran into bitter opposition for teaching that believing Gentiles now enjoyed equal rights and privileges with believing Jews in the Christian church. What finally triggered his arrest and trial before Caesar was a false charge that he had taken Trophimus, an Ephesian, into the temple area that was out of bounds for Gentiles (Acts 21:29). But behind the charge was the already fierce hostility of the religious leaders.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:2</span> Now Paul breaks his train of thought and launches into a discourse on the mystery, in what we have already referred to as a literary parenthesis dealing with a dispensational parenthesis.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <b class="calibre5">if</b> in verse 2 (<b class="calibre5">if indeed you have heard</b> …) might create the impression that the apostle’s readers did not know of his special mission to the Gentiles. In fact, this verse is sometimes used to prove that Paul did not know the persons to whom he wrote and that therefore the Letter could not have been written to the beloved Ephesians. But “if” often carries the meaning of “since.” Thus Phillips paraphrases it, “For you must have heard …” They had surely known that this special ministry had been committed to him. He describes that ministry as a <b class="calibre5">dispensation of the grace of God</b>. Here <b class="calibre5">dispensation</b> refers to a stewardship. A steward is one who is appointed to administer the affairs of someone else. Paul was God’s steward, charged with setting forth the great truth regarding the NT church. It was a stewardship of God’s <b class="calibre5">grace</b> in at least three senses:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. As to the one chosen. It was undeserved favor to Paul that selected him for such a high privilege.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. As to the contents of the message. It was the message of God’s free and unmerited kindness.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. As to its recipients. The Gentiles were quite unworthy people to be so favored.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Yet this stewardship of <b class="calibre5">grace</b> was given to Paul in order that he in turn might impart it to the Gentiles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:3</span> He had not learned <b class="calibre5">the mystery</b> from anyone else, nor had he discovered it through his own intelligence. It was <b class="calibre5">made known to</b> him <b class="calibre5">by</b> direct <b class="calibre5">revelation</b> from God. We are not told where this happened, or how; all we know is that in some miraculous way God showed Paul His plan for a church composed of converted Jews and converted Gentiles. We have already mentioned that a <b class="calibre5">mystery</b> is a sacred secret hitherto unknown, humanly unknowable, and now divinely revealed. The apostle had alluded to <b class="calibre5">the mystery</b> briefly in 1:9–14, 22, 23; 2:11–22.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:4</span> What he had already written on the subject was sufficient to demonstrate to his readers that he had a God-given insight into <b class="calibre5">the mystery of</b> the <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. Blaikie paraphrases this passage as follows:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">With reference to which, <i class="calibre3">i.e.,</i> to what I wrote afore: to make that more intelligible I write on the subject more fully now, so that you shall see that your instructor is thoroughly informed in this matter of the mystery….<a id="calibre_link-86" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-50">17</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Darby’s translation, “the mystery of <i class="calibre3">the</i> Christ,” suggests that it is the mystical Christ that is in view here, that is, the Head <i class="calibre3">and</i> the Body. (For another instance of the name <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> including both the Lord Jesus and His people, see 1 Cor. 12:12.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:5</span> Verses 5 and 6 give us the most complete definition we have of the mystery. Paul explains what a mystery is, then he explains what the mystery of the Christ is.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, it is a truth <b class="calibre5">which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men</b>. This means it is futile to look for it in the OT. There may be types and pictures of it there, but the truth itself was unknown at that time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Second, it is a truth which <b class="calibre5">has now been revealed by the</b> Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> to God’s <b class="calibre5">holy apostles and prophets</b>. God was the Revealer; the <b class="calibre5">apostles and prophets</b> were the ones set apart to receive the revelation; <b class="calibre5">the</b> Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> was the channel through whom the revelation came to them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Unless we see that the <b class="calibre5">apostles and prophets</b> were those of the NT, not the OT period, this verse is contradictory. The first part says this truth was not revealed in other ages; therefore it was unknown to the OT prophets. How then could it be made known in Paul’s day by men who had been dead for centuries? The obvious meaning is that the great truth of Christ and the church was made known to men of the Church Age like Paul who were specially commissioned by the risen Lord to serve as His spokesmen or mouthpieces. (Paul does not claim to be the <i class="calibre3">only</i> one to whom this sacred secret was disclosed; he was one among many, though he was the foremost in transmitting the truth to Gentiles of his day, and to succeeding generations through his Epistles.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is only fair to mention that many Christians take quite a different view from that given above. They say the church actually did exist in the OT; that Israel was then the church; but that the truth of the church has now been more fully revealed. They say, “The mystery was not known in other ages <i class="calibre3">as</i> it is now revealed. It was known <i class="calibre3">but not to the same extent as now</i>. We have a <i class="calibre3">fuller revelation</i>, but we are still the Israel of God, that is, a continuation of God’s people.” To support their argument, they point to Acts 7:38 in the 1611 KJV, where the nation of Israel is called “the church (NKJV, NASB, <i class="calibre3">congregation</i>) in the wilderness.” It is true that God’s chosen people are spoken of as the congregation in the wilderness, but this does not mean they have any connection with the <i class="calibre3">Christian</i> church. After all, the Greek word <span class="calibre3">ekklēsia</span> is a general term which can mean any assembly, congregation, or called-out group. It is not only applied to Israel in Acts 7:38; the same word, translated <i class="calibre3">assembly</i>, is used in Acts 19:32, 41 of a heathen mob. We have to determine from the context <i class="calibre3">which</i> “church” or assembly is meant.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But what about the argument that verse 5 means the church existed in the OT though it was not as fully revealed then as now? This is answered in Colossians 1:26, which states flatly that the mystery was “hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints.” It is not a question of the degree of revelation but of the fact of it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:6</span> Now we come to the central truth of the mystery, namely, that in the church of the Lord Jesus Christ, believing <b class="calibre5">Gentiles</b> are <b class="calibre5">fellow heirs</b>, fellow members, and fellow <b class="calibre5">partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel</b>. In other words, converted <b class="calibre5">Gentiles</b> now enjoy equal title and privileges with converted Jews.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, they are <b class="calibre5">fellow heirs</b>. As far as the inheritance is concerned, they share equally with saved Jews. They are heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ, and <b class="calibre5">fellow heirs</b> with all the redeemed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then they are fellow members <b class="calibre5">of the same body</b>. They are at no distance or disadvantage now, but share a position of equality with saved Jews in the church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, they are fellow <b class="calibre5">partakers</b> of the <b class="calibre5">promise in Christ through the gospel</b>. The <b class="calibre5">promise</b> here may mean the Holy Spirit (Acts 15:8; Gal. 3:14), or it may take in all that is promised in <b class="calibre5">the gospel</b> to those who are <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b> Jesus. <b class="calibre5">Gentiles</b> are copartners with Jews in all of this.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">None of this was true in the OT dispensation, nor will it be true in the coming kingdom of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the OT, Israel held a distinct place of privilege before God. A Jew would have laughed at any suggestion that a Gentile held an equal share with him in the promises of God. It simply was not true. The prophets of Israel did predict the call of the Gentiles (Isa. 49:6; 56:6, 7), but they nowhere hinted that Gentiles would be fellow members of a body in which Jews did not have any priority.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the coming kingdom of our Lord, Israel will be the head of the nations (Isa. 60:12); Gentiles will be blessed, but it will be through Israel (Isa. 60:3; 61:6; Zech. 8:23).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The calling of Israel was primarily, though not exclusively, to temporal blessings in earthly places (Deut. 28; Amos 9:13–15). The calling of the church is primarily to spiritual blessings in heavenly places (Eph. 1:3). Israel was called to be God’s chosen earthly people. The church is called to be the heavenly Bride of Christ (Rev. 21:2, 9). Israel will be blessed under the rule of Christ in the Millennium (Hos. 3:5); the church will reign with Him over the entire universe, sharing His glory (Eph. 1:22, 23).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Therefore it should be clear that the church is not the same as Israel or the kingdom. It is a new society, a unique fellowship, and the most privileged body of believers we read about in the Bible. The church came into being after Christ ascended and the Holy Spirit was given (Acts 2). It was formed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). And it will be completed at the Rapture, when all who belong to Christ will be taken home to heaven (1 Thess. 4:13–18; 1 Cor. 15:23, 51–58.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:7</span> Having emphasized the equal partnership of Gentiles and Jews in the church, Paul now moves on to discuss his own ministry in connection with it (vv. 7–9).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, he <b class="calibre5">became a minister</b> of the gospel. Wuest writes, “The word ‘minister’ is misleading, since it is the technical word used today to designate the pastor of a church.” It never means that in the NT. The basic meaning of the word is <i class="calibre3">servant</i>; Paul simply meant he served the Lord in connection with the mystery.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The ministry was in the nature of an undeserved gift: <b class="calibre5">according to the gift of the grace of God given to me</b>. And it was not only a display of <b class="calibre5">grace</b>; it also demonstrated God’s <b class="calibre5">power</b> in effectually reaching the proud, self-righteous Pharisee, saving his soul, commissioning him as an apostle, empowering him to receive revelations, and strengthening him for the work. So Paul says <b class="calibre5">the gift</b> was given to him <b class="calibre5">by the effective working of His power.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:8</span> The apostle speaks of himself as <b class="calibre5">less than the least of all the saints</b>. This might seem like mock humility to some. Actually it is the true self-estimate of one who is filled by the Holy Spirit. Anyone who sees Christ in His glory realizes his own sinfulness and uselessness. In Paul’s case there was the added memory that he had persecuted the Lord Jesus (Acts 9:4) by persecuting the church of God (Gal. 1:13; Phil. 3:6). In spite of this, the Lord had commissioned him in a special way to take the gospel to <b class="calibre5">the Gentiles</b> (Acts 9:15; 13:47; 22:21; Gal. 2:2, 8). Paul was the apostle to <b class="calibre5">the Gentiles</b> as Peter was to the Jews. His ministry was twofold: it concerned the gospel, and it concerned the church. First, he told men how to be saved, then he led them on into the truth of the NT church. For him evangelism was not an end in itself but a step toward establishing and strengthening indigenous NT churches.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first function of his ministry was to <b class="calibre5">preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ</b>. Blaikie expresses it well:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Two attractive words, <i class="calibre3">riches</i> and <i class="calibre3">unsearchable</i>, conveying the idea of the things that are most precious being infinitely abundant. Usually precious things are rare; their very rarity increases their price; but here that which is most precious is also boundless—riches of compassion and love, of merit, of sanctifying, comforting and transforming power, all without limit, and capable of satisfying every want, craving, and yearning of the heart, now and evermore.<a id="calibre_link-87" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-51">18</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft">When a person trusts the Lord Jesus, he immediately becomes a spiritual billionaire; in Christ he possesses inexhaustible treasures.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:9</span> The second part of Paul’s ministry was <b class="calibre5">to make all see what is</b> “the administration of the mystery” (JND), in other words, to enlighten them as to how <b class="calibre5">the mystery</b> is being worked out in practice. God’s plan for this present age is to call out of the Gentiles a people for His name (Acts 15:14), a Bride for His Son. All that is involved in this plan is the administration (<i class="calibre3">stewardship</i>, NKJV marg.<a id="calibre_link-88" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-52">19</a>) <b class="calibre5">of the mystery</b>. <b class="calibre5">All</b> here must mean <b class="calibre5">all</b> <i class="calibre3">believers</i>. Unsaved people could not be expected to understand the deep truths of <b class="calibre5">the mystery</b> (1 Cor. 2:14). Paul therefore is referring to <b class="calibre5">all</b> in the sense of saved people of <b class="calibre5">all</b> <i class="calibre3">kinds</i>—Jews and Gentiles, slave and free.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This <b class="calibre5">mystery</b> had <b class="calibre5">from the beginning of the ages been hidden in God</b>. The plan was itself in the mind of God eternally, but here the thought is that He kept it a secret throughout <b class="calibre5">the ages</b> of human history. Once again we notice the care the Holy Spirit takes to impress us with the fact that the assembly, or church universal, is something new, unique, unprecedented. It was not known before to anyone but God. The secret was <b class="calibre5">hidden in God who created all things</b>. He <b class="calibre5">created</b> the material universe, He <b class="calibre5">created the ages</b>, and He <b class="calibre5">created</b> the church—but in His wisdom He decided to withhold any knowledge of this new creation until the First Advent of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:10</span> One of God’s present purposes in connection with the mystery is to reveal His <b class="calibre5">manifold wisdom</b> to the angelic hosts of heaven. Paul again uses the metaphor of a school. God is the Teacher. The universe is the classroom. Angelic dignitaries are the students. The lesson is on “The multi-faceted <b class="calibre5">wisdom of God</b>.” <b class="calibre5">The church</b> is the object lesson. From heaven the angels are compelled to admire His unsearchable judgments and marvel at His ways past finding out. They see how God has triumphed over sin to His own glory. They see how He has sent heaven’s Best for earth’s worst. They see how He has redeemed His enemies at enormous cost, conquered them by love, and prepared them as a Bride for His Son. They see how He has blessed them with all spiritual blessings in the heavenlies. And they see that through the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross, more glory has come to God and more blessing has come to believing Jews and Gentiles than if sin had never been allowed to enter. God has been vindicated; Christ has been exalted; Satan has been defeated; and the church has been enthroned in Christ to share His glory.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:11</span> The mystery itself, its concealment, its eventual disclosure, and the manner in which it exhibits the wisdom of God are all <b class="calibre5">according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord</b>. Before the world was made, God knew Satan would fall and man would follow him in sin. And He had already prepared a counter-strategy, a master plan. This plan has been worked out in the incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, and glorification of Christ. The whole program centered in Christ and has been realized through Him. Now God can save ungodly Jews and Gentiles, make them members of the Body of Christ, conform them to the image of His Son, and honor them in a unique way as the Bride of the Lamb throughout eternity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:12</span> As a result of Christ’s work and our union with Him, we now have the unspeakable privilege of entering into God’s presence at any time, in full confidence of being heard, and without any fear of being scolded (Jas 1:5). Our <b class="calibre5">boldness</b> is the respectful attitude and absence of fear we have as children addressing their Father. Our <b class="calibre5">access</b> is our liberty to speak to God in prayer. Our <b class="calibre5">confidence</b> is the assurance of a welcome, a hearing, and a wise and loving answer. And it is all <b class="calibre5">through faith in Him</b>, that is, our <b class="calibre5">faith in</b> the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:13</span> In view of the dignity of his ministry and the wonderful results that flowed from it, Paul encouraged the saints not to be disheartened when they thought of his sufferings. He was glad to endure <b class="calibre5">tribulations</b> in carrying out his mission to the Gentiles. Rather than being discouraged by his troubles, he says, in effect, they should be proud he was counted worthy to suffer for the Lord Jesus. They should rejoice to think of the benefit of his <b class="calibre5">tribulations</b> to them and to other Gentiles. They should see his current imprisonment as <b class="calibre5">glory</b>, not disgrace.</p>

      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:14</span> Now the apostle picks up the thought he had begun in verse 1 and had interrupted with a parenthetical section on the mystery. Therefore, the words <b class="calibre5">For this reason</b> refer back to chapter 2 with its description of what the Gentiles had been by nature and what they had become through union with Christ. Their astonishing rise from poverty and death to riches and glory drives Paul to pray they will always live in the practical enjoyment of their exalted position.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">His posture in prayer is indicated: <b class="calibre5">I bow my knees</b>. This does not mean kneeling must always be the posture of the body, though it should always be the posture of the soul. We may pray as we walk, sit, or recline, but our spirits should be bowed in humility and reverence.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The prayer is addressed <b class="calibre5">to the Father</b>. In a general sense, God is the Father of all mankind, meaning He is their Creator (Acts 17:28, 29). In a more restricted sense, He is the Father of all believers, meaning He has begotten them into His spiritual family (Gal. 4:6). In a unique sense He is <b class="calibre5">the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>, meaning They are equal (John 5:18).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:15</span> The particular role of the Father which Paul has in view is as the One <b class="calibre5">from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named</b>. This may mean:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. All the redeemed in heaven and on earth look to Him as Head of the family.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2 All created beings, angelic and human, owe their existence to Him not only as individuals but as families as well. Families in heaven include the various grades of angelic creatures. Families on earth are the different races springing from Noah and now divided into various nations.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. All fatherhood in the universe derives its name from Him. The Fatherhood of God is the original and the ideal; it is the prototype of every other paternal relationship. Phillips translates the verse, “from whom all fatherhood, earthly or heavenly, derives its name.”</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:16</span> We cannot help but be struck by the vastness of Paul’s request: That He would grant you, <b class="calibre5">according to the riches of His glory</b>. He is going to ask that the saints might <b class="calibre5">be</b> spiritually <b class="calibre5">strengthened</b>. But to what extent? Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown answer: “in abundance, consonant to the riches of His glory; not ‘according to’ the narrowness of our hearts.”<a id="calibre_link-89" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-54">20</a> Preachers often point out that there is a difference between the expressions “out of the riches” and <b class="calibre5">according to the riches</b>. A wealthy person might give a trifling amount; it would be <i class="calibre3">out of</i> his riches, but <i class="calibre3">not in proportion</i> to them! Paul asks that God will give strength <b class="calibre5">according to</b> the riches of His perfections. Since the Lord is infinitely rich in glory, let the saints get ready for a deluge! Why should we ask so little of so great a King? When someone asked a tremendous favor of Napoleon it was immediately granted because, said Napoleon, “He honored me by the magnitude of his request.”</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Thou art coming to a King,</p>
        <p class="sl">Large petitions with thee bring;</p>
        <p class="sl">For His grace and power are such,</p>
        <p class="sl">None can ever ask too much.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">John Newton</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Now we come to Paul’s specific prayer requests. Instead of a series of disconnected petitions, we should think of them as a progression in which each petition lays the groundwork for the next. Picture them as a pyramid: the first request is the bottom layer of stones. As the prayer advances, Paul builds toward a glorious climax.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first request is that they would <b class="calibre5">be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man</b>. The blessing sought is <i class="calibre3">spiritual</i> power. Not the power to perform spectacular miracles, but the spiritual vigor needed to be mature, stable, intelligent Christians. The One who imparts this power is the Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b>. Of course, He can give us strength only as we feed on the word of God, as we breathe the pure air of prayer, and as we get exercise in daily service for the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This power is experienced <b class="calibre5">in the inner man</b>, that is, the spiritual part of our nature. It is <b class="calibre5">the inner man</b> that delights in the law of God (Rom. 7:22). It is <b class="calibre5">the inner man</b> that is renewed day by day, even though the outward man is perishing (2 Cor. 4:16). Though it is of God, our <b class="calibre5">inner man</b> needs strength, growth, and development.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:17</span> The second step is <b class="calibre5">that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith</b>. This is the result of the Spirit’s invigoration: we are strengthened in order <b class="calibre5">that Christ may dwell in</b> our <b class="calibre5">hearts</b>. Actually, the Lord Jesus takes up His personal residence in a believer at the time of conversion (John 14:23; Rev. 3:20). But that is not the subject of this prayer. Here it is not a question of His being <i class="calibre3">in</i> the believer, but rather of His feeling <i class="calibre3">at home</i> there! He is a permanent Resident in every saved person, but this is a request that He might have full access to every room and closet; that He might not be grieved by sinful words, thoughts, motives, and deeds; that He might enjoy unbroken fellowship with the believer. The Christian heart thus becomes the home of Christ, the place where He loves to be—like the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus in Bethany. The heart, of course, means the center of the spiritual life; it controls every aspect of behavior. In effect, the apostle prays that the lordship of Christ might extend to the books we read, the work we do, the food we eat, the money we spend, the words we speak—in short, the minutest details of our lives.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The more we are strengthened by the Holy Spirit, the more we will be like the Lord Jesus Himself. And the more we are like Him, the more He will “settle down and feel completely at home in our hearts” (KSW).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We enter into the enjoyment of His indwelling <b class="calibre5">through faith</b>. This involves constant dependence on Him, constant surrender to Him, and constant recognition of His “at home-ness.” It is <b class="calibre5">through faith</b> that we “practice His presence,” as Brother Lawrence quaintly put it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Up to this point Paul’s prayer has involved each member of the Trinity. The Father is asked (v. 14) to strengthen the believers through His Spirit (v. 16) <b class="calibre5">that Christ</b> might be completely at home in their <b class="calibre5">hearts</b> (v. 17). One of the great privileges of prayer is that we can engage the eternal Godhead to work in behalf of others and ourselves.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The result of Christ’s unrestricted access is that the Christian becomes <b class="calibre5">rooted and grounded in love</b>. Here Paul borrows words from the worlds of botany and building. The root of a plant provides nourishment and support. The groundwork of a building is the foundation on which it rests. As Scroggie says, “Love is the soil in which our life must have its roots; and it is the rock upon which our faith must ever rest.”<a id="calibre_link-90" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-55">21</a> To be <b class="calibre5">rooted and grounded in love</b> is to be established <b class="calibre5">in love</b> as a way of life. The life of <b class="calibre5">love</b> is a life of kindness, selflessness, brokenness, and meekness. It is the life of Christ finding expression in the believer (see 1 Cor. 13:4–7).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:18</span> The preceding requests have outlined a program of spiritual growth and development which prepares the child of God to be fully able to grasp <b class="calibre5">with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Before we consider the dimensions themselves, let us notice the expression <b class="calibre5">with all the saints</b>. The subject is so great that no one believer can possibly grasp more than a small fraction of it. So there is need to study, discuss, and share with others. The Holy Spirit can use the combined meditations of a group of exercised believers to throw a flood of additional light on the Scriptures.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The dimensions are generally taken to refer to the love of Christ, although the text does not say this. In fact, the love of Christ is mentioned separately in the following clause. If the love of Christ is intended, then the connection might be shown as follows:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">Width—The world (John 3:16)</li>
        <li class="ul">Length—Forever (1 Cor. 13:8)</li>
        <li class="ul">Depth—Even the death of the cross (Phil. 2:8)</li>
        <li class="ull">Height—Heaven (1 John 3:1–2)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">F. B. Meyer expresses it well:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">There will always be as much horizon before us as behind us. And when we have been gazing on the face of Jesus for millenniums, its beauty will be as fresh and fascinating and fathomless as when we first saw it from the gate of Paradise.<a id="calibre_link-91" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-56">22</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">But these dimensions may also refer to the mystery which holds such an important place in Ephesians. In fact, it is easy to find these dimensions in the text itself:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The <b class="calibre5">width</b> is described in 2:11–18. It refers to the wideness of God’s grace in saving Jews and Gentiles, and then incorporating them into the church. The mystery embraces both these segments of humanity.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The <b class="calibre5">length</b> extends from eternity to eternity. As to the past, believers were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (1:4). As to the future, eternity will be a perpetual unfolding of the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus (2:7).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. The <b class="calibre5">depth</b> is vividly portrayed in 2:1–3. We were sunk in a pit of unspeakable sin and degradation. Christ came to this jungle of filth and corruption in order to die in our behalf.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. The <b class="calibre5">height</b> is seen in 2:6, where we have not only been raised up with Christ, but enthroned in Him in the heavenlies to share His glory.
          <p class="calibre2">These are the dimensions, then, of immensity and, indeed, infinity. As we think of them, “all we can do,” Scroggie says, “is to mark the order in this tumult of holy words.”</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:19</span> The apostle’s next request is that the saints might <b class="calibre5">know</b> by experience <b class="calibre5">the</b> knowledge-surpassing <b class="calibre5">love of Christ</b>. They could never explore it fully, because it is an ocean without shores, but they could learn more and more about it from day to day. And so he prays for a deep, experimental knowledge and enjoyment of the wonderful <b class="calibre5">love</b> of our wonderful Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The climax in this magnificent prayer is reached when Paul prays <b class="calibre5">that you may be filled with</b> (lit. <i class="calibre3">unto</i>, Gk. <span class="calibre3">eis</span>) <b class="calibre5">all the fullness of God</b>. <b class="calibre5">All the fullness</b> of the Godhead dwells in the Lord Jesus (Col. 2:9). The more He dwells in our hearts by faith, the more we are <b class="calibre5">filled</b> unto <b class="calibre5">all the fullness of God</b>. We could never be filled <i class="calibre3">with</i> all the fullness of God. But it is a goal toward which we move.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And yet having explained this, we must say there are depths of meaning here we have not reached. As we handle the Scriptures, we are aware that we are dealing with truths that are greater than our ability to understand or explain. We can use illustrations to throw light on this verse, for example, the thimble dipped in the ocean is filled with water, but how little of the ocean is in the thimble! Yet when we have said all this, the mystery remains, and we can only stand in awe at God’s word and marvel at its infinity.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-126" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-57">H. Paul’s Doxology (3:20, 21)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:20</span> The prayer closes with a soul-inspiring doxology. The preceding requests have been vast, bold, and seemingly impossible. But God <b class="calibre5">is able to do</b> more in this connection than <b class="calibre5">we</b> can <b class="calibre5">ask or think</b>. The extent of His ability is seen in the manner in which Paul pyramids words to describe superabundant blessings:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf"><b class="calibre5">Able</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do what we ask</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do what we think</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do what we ask or think</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do all that we ask or think</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do above all that we ask or think</b></li>
        <li class="ul"><b class="calibre5">Able to do abundantly above all that we ask or think</b></li>
        <li class="ull"><b class="calibre5">Able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">The means by which God answers prayer is given in the expression <b class="calibre5">according to the power that works in us</b>. This refers to the Holy Spirit, who is constantly at work in our lives, seeking to produce the fruit of a Christlike character, rebuking us because of sin, guiding us in prayer, inspiring us in worship, directing us in service. The more we are yielded to Him, the greater will be His effectiveness in conforming us to Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:21</span> <b class="calibre5">To Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</b> God is the worthy object of eternal praise. His wisdom and power are displayed in the angelic hosts; in sun, moon, and stars; in animals, birds, and fish; in fire, hail, snow, and mist; in wind; in mountains, hills, trees; in kings and people, old men and young; in Israel and the nations. All these are intended to praise the name of the Lord (Ps. 148).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But there is another group from which endless <b class="calibre5">glory</b> will be given to God, that is, <b class="calibre5">the church</b>—Christ the Head and believers, the Body. This redeemed community will be an eternal witness to His matchless, marvelous grace. Williams writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The eternal glory of God as God and Father will be made visible throughout all ages in the Church and in Christ Jesus. Amazing statement! Christ and the Church as One Body will be the vehicle of that eternal demonstration.<a id="calibre_link-92" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-58">23</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Even now the church should be giving glory to His name “in the services of praise, in the pure lives of its members, in its world-wide proclamation of the Gospel, and in its ministries to human distress and need” (Erdman).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The duration of this praise is <b class="calibre5">to all generations, forever and ever</b>. As we hear Paul call for eternal praise to God in the church and in Christ Jesus, the response of our hearts is a hearty <b class="calibre5">Amen!</b></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-127" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-3">II. THE BELIEVER’S PRACTICE IN THE LORD (Chaps. 4–6)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-128" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-4">A. Appeal for Unity in the Christian Fellowship (4:1–6)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:1</span> There is a major break at this point in Ephesians. The previous chapters have dealt with the Christian’s calling. In the last three chapters, he is urged to <b class="calibre5">walk worthy of</b> his <b class="calibre5">calling</b>. The position into which grace has lifted us was the dominant theme up to now. From here on it will be the practical outworking of that position. Our exalted standing in Christ calls for corresponding godly conduct. So it is true that Ephesians moves from the heavenlies in chapters 1–3, to the local church, to the home, and to general society in chapters 4–6. As Stott has pointed out, these closing chapters teach that “we must cultivate unity in the church, purity in our personal lives, harmony in our homes and stability in our combat with the powers of evil.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For the second time Paul refers to himself as a <b class="calibre5">prisoner</b>—this time as a <b class="calibre5">prisoner of the Lord</b>. Theodoret comments: “What the world counted ignominy, he counts the highest honor, and he glories in his bonds for Christ, more than a king in his diadem.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As one who was imprisoned as a result of faithfulness and obedience to the Lord, Paul exhorts his readers <b class="calibre5">to walk worthy of</b> their <b class="calibre5">calling</b>. He does not command or direct. With tenderness and gentleness he appeals to them in the language of grace.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The word <b class="calibre5">walk</b> is found seven times in this Letter (2:2, 10; 4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15); it describes a person’s entire lifestyle. A <b class="calibre5">worthy</b> walk is one that is consistent with a Christian’s dignified position as a member of the Body of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:2</span> In every sphere of life, it is important to show a Christlike spirit. This consists of:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Lowliness</b>—a genuine humility that comes from association with the Lord Jesus. <b class="calibre5">Lowliness</b> makes us conscious of our own nothingness and enables us to esteem others better than ourselves. It is the opposite of conceit and arrogance.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Gentleness</b>—the attitude that submits to God’s dealings without rebellion, and to man’s unkindness without retaliation. It is best seen in the life of Him who said, “I am gentle and lowly in heart.” Wright comments:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">What an astonishingly wonderful statement! The One who made the worlds, who flung the stars into space and calls them by name, who preserves the innumerable constellations in their courses, who weighs the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance, who takes up the isles as a very little thing, who holds the waters of the ocean in the hollow of His hand, before whom the inhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers, when He comes into human life finds Himself as essentially meek and lowly in heart. It is not that He erected a perfect human ideal and accommodated Himself to it; He <b class="calibre5">was</b> that.<a id="calibre_link-93" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-5">24</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Longsuffering</b>—an even disposition and a spirit of patience under prolonged provocation. This has been illustrated as follows: Imagine a puppy and a big dog together. As the puppy barks at the big dog, worrying and attacking him, the big dog, who could snap up the puppy with one bite, patiently puts up with the puppy’s impertinence.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Bearing with one another in love</b>—that is, making allowance for the faults and failures of others, or differing personalities, abilities, and temperaments. And it is not a question of maintaining a façade of courtesy while inwardly seething with resentment. It means positive love to those who irritate, disturb, or embarrass.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:3</span> <b class="calibre5">Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</b> In forming the church, God had eliminated the greatest division that had ever existed among human beings—the rift between Jews and Gentiles. In Christ Jesus these distinctions were abolished. But how would it work out in their life together? Would there still be lingering antagonisms? Would there be a tendency to form a “Jewish Church of Christ” and a “Church for the Nations”? To guard against any divisions or smoldering animosities, Paul now pleads for unity among Christians.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">They should give diligence <b class="calibre5">to keep the unity of the Spirit</b>. The Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> has made all true believers one in Christ; the Body is indwelt by one <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b>. This is a basic <b class="calibre5">unity</b> that nothing can destroy. But by quarreling and bickering, believers can act as if it were not so. <b class="calibre5">To keep the unity of the Spirit</b> means to live at peace with one another. <b class="calibre5">Peace</b> is the ligament which binds the members of the Body together in spite of their wide natural differences. A common reaction when differences arise is to divide and start another party. The spiritual reaction is this: “In essentials, unity. In doubtful questions, liberty. In all things, charity.” There is enough of the flesh in every one of us to wreck any local church or any other work of God. Therefore, we must submerge our own petty, personal whims and attitudes, and work together in <b class="calibre5">peace</b> for the glory of God and for common blessing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:4</span> Instead of magnifying differences, we should think of the seven positive realities which form the basis of true Christian unity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">One body</b>. In spite of differences in race, color, nationality, culture, language, and temperament, there is only <b class="calibre5">one body</b>, made up of all true believers from Pentecost to the Rapture. Denominations, sects, and parties hinder the outworking of this truth. All such man-made divisions will be swept away when the Savior returns. Therefore, our watchword at the present time should be, “Let names and sects and parties fall, and Jesus Christ be all in all.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">One Spirit</b>. The same Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> who indwells each believer individually (1 Cor. 6:19) also indwells the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 3:16).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">One hope</b>. Every member of the church is called to one destiny—to be with Christ, to be like Him, and to share His glory endlessly. The <b class="calibre5">one hope</b> includes all that awaits the saints at the Return of the Lord Jesus and thereafter.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:5</span> <b class="calibre5">One Lord</b>. “For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), yet for us there is one God, … and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live” (1 Cor. 8:5, 6; see also 1 Cor. 1:2.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">One faith</b>. This is the Christian <b class="calibre5">faith</b>, the body of doctrine “once for all delivered to the saints” (Jude 3), and preserved for us in the NT.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">One baptism</b>. There is a twofold sense in which this is true. First, there is <b class="calibre5">one baptism</b> by the Spirit, by which those who trust Christ are placed in the body (1 Cor. 12:13). Then there is <b class="calibre5">one baptism</b> by which converts confess their identification with Christ in death, burial, and resurrection. Though there are different modes of baptism today, the NT recognizes one believers’ baptism, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. By being baptized, disciples express allegiance to Christ, the burial of their old self, and a determination to walk in newness of life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:6</span> <b class="calibre5">One God</b>. Every child of God recognizes <b class="calibre5">one God and Father of all</b> the redeemed, who is:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ul3f"><b class="calibre5">Above all</b>—He is the supreme Sovereign of the universe.</li>
        <li class="ul2"><b class="calibre5">Through all</b>—He acts through all, using everything to accomplish His purposes.</li>
        <li class="ul2"><b class="calibre5">In you all</b>—He dwells in all believers, and is present in all places at one and the same time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-129" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-6">B. Program for Proper Functioning of the Members of the Body (4:7–16)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:7</span> The doctrine of the unity of the Body of Christ has a twin truth, namely, the diversity of its members. Each member has a particular role assigned. No two members are alike, and no two have exactly the same function. The part to be played by each one is assigned <b class="calibre5">according to the measure of Christ’s gift</b>, that is, He does it as He sees fit. If <b class="calibre5">Christ’s gift</b> here means the Holy Spirit (John 14:16, 17; Acts 2:38, 39), then the thought is that the Holy Spirit is the One who assigns some gift to every saint, and who also gives the ability to exercise that gift. As each member fulfills his appointed work, the Body of Christ grows both spiritually and numerically.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:8</span><a id="calibre_link-69" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-7">†</a> In order to assist each child of God to find and fulfill his function, the Lord has given some special <b class="calibre5">gifts</b> of ministry, or service to the church. These should not be confused with the gifts mentioned in the previous verse. Every believer has some gift (v. 7), but not everyone is one of the <b class="calibre5">gifts</b> named in verse 11: these are special <b class="calibre5">gifts</b> designed for the growth of the body.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, we find that the Giver of those special <b class="calibre5">gifts</b> is the risen, ascended, glorified Lord Jesus Christ. Paul quotes Psalm 68:18 as a prophecy that the Messiah would ascend to heaven, would conquer His foes and lead them <b class="calibre5">captive</b>, and, as a reward for His victory, would receive <b class="calibre5">gifts</b> for <b class="calibre5">men</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:9</span> But this raises a problem! How could the Messiah ascend to heaven? Had He not lived in heaven with God the Father from all eternity? Obviously, if He was to ascend to heaven, He must first come down from heaven. The prophecy of His Ascension in Psalm 68:18 implies a prior descent. So we might paraphrase verse 9 as follows: <b class="calibre5">“Now</b> when it says in Psalm 68 <b class="calibre5">‘He ascended’—what does it mean but that He also first descended into the lower parts of the earth.”</b> We know that this is exactly what happened. The Lord Jesus <b class="calibre5">descended</b> to Bethlehem’s manger, to the death of the cross, and to the grave. <b class="calibre5">The lower parts of the earth</b> have sometimes been taken to refer to hades or hell. But that would not fit in with the argument here: His Ascension necessitated a previous descent to earth but not to hell. In addition, the Scriptures indicate that Christ’s spirit went to heaven, not hell, when He died (Luke 23:43, 46).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The New English Bible translates this verse: “Now the word ‘ascended’ implies that he also descended to the lowest level, down to the very earth.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:10</span> The prophecy of Psalm 68:18 and the descent implied in the prophecy were exactly fulfilled by the Incarnation, death, and burial of the Lord Jesus. The One <b class="calibre5">who descended</b> from heaven <b class="calibre5">is also the One who</b> conquered sin, Satan, demons, and death, and <b class="calibre5">who ascended far above</b> the atmosphere and stellar <b class="calibre5">heavens, that He might fill all things</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">He</b> does <b class="calibre5">fill all things</b> in the sense that He is the source of all blessing, the sum of all virtues, and the supreme Sovereign over all. “There is not a place between the depth of the cross and the height of the glory which He has not occupied,” writes F. W. Grant.<a id="calibre_link-94" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-8">25</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The central thought in verses 8–10 is that the Giver of the gifts is the ascended Christ. There were no such gifts before He went back to heaven. This lends further support to the contention that the church did not exist in the OT; for if it did, it was a church without gifts.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:11</span> The names of the gifts are now given. To our surprise we find they are men, not natural endowments or talents. <b class="calibre5">He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Apostles</b> were men who were directly commissioned by the Lord to preach the word and to plant churches. They were men who had seen Christ in resurrection (Acts 1:22). They had power to perform miracles (2 Cor. 12:12) as a means of confirming the message they preached (Heb. 2:4). Together with NT prophets, their ministry was primarily concerned with the foundation of the church (Eph. 2:20). The apostles referred to in this passage mean only those who were apostles <i class="calibre3">after</i> the Ascension of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Prophets</b> were spokesmen or mouthpieces of God. They received direct revelations from the Lord and passed them on to the church. What they spoke by the Holy Spirit was the word of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the primary sense we no longer have apostles and prophets. Their ministry ended when the foundation of the church was laid, and when the NT canon was completed. We have already emphasized that Paul is speaking here of NT <b class="calibre5">prophets</b>; they were given by Christ after His Ascension. To think of them as OT prophets introduces difficulties and absurdities into the passage.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Evangelists</b> are those who preach the good news of salvation. They are divinely equipped to win the lost to Christ. They have special ability to diagnose a sinner’s condition, probe the conscience, answer objections, encourage decisions for Christ, and help the convert find assurance through the word. Evangelists should go out from a local church, preach to the world, then lead their converts to a local church where they will be fed and encouraged.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Pastors</b> are men who serve as undershepherds of the sheep of Christ. They guide and feed the flock. Theirs is a ministry of wise counsel, correction, encouragement, and consolation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The work of <b class="calibre5">pastors</b> is closely related to that of elders in a local church, the principal difference being that a pastor is a gift whereas the elder is an office. The NT pictures a number of pastors in a local church (Acts 20:17, 28; 1 Pet. 5:1, 2) rather than one pastor or presiding elder.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Teachers</b> are men who are divinely empowered to explain what the Bible says, interpret what it means, and apply it to the hearts and consciences of the saints. Whereas an evangelist may preach the gospel from a passage out of context, the teacher seeks to show how the passage fits into the context.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Because <b class="calibre5">pastors and teachers</b> are linked in this verse, some conclude only one gift is intended, that it should read “pastor-teachers.” But this is not necessarily so. A man may be a teacher without having the heart of a shepherd. And a pastor may be able to use the word without having the distinctive gift of teaching. If <b class="calibre5">pastors and teachers</b> are the same persons here in verse 11, then, by the same rule of grammar,<a id="calibre_link-95" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-9">26</a> so are apostles and prophets in 2:20.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One final word. We should be careful to distinguish between divine gifts and natural talents. No unsaved person, however talented, could be an evangelist, pastor, or teacher in the NT sense. Neither could a Christian, for that matter, unless he has received that particular gift. The gifts of the Spirit are supernatural. They enable a man to do what would be humanly impossible for him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:12</span> We come now to the function or purpose of the gifts. It is <b class="calibre5">for the equipping of the saints for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ</b>. The process is this:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The gifts equip <b class="calibre5">the saints</b>.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. <b class="calibre5">The saints</b> then serve.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. The <b class="calibre5">body</b> is then built up.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The ministry</b> is not a specialized occupation limited to men with professional training. The word simply means <i class="calibre3">service</i>. It includes every form of spiritual service. And what this verse teaches is that every believer should be “in the ministry.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The gifts are given to perfect or equip all Christians to serve the Lord, and thus to build up <b class="calibre5">the body of Christ</b>. Vance Havner explains in his inimitable way:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Every Christian is commissioned, for every Christian is a missionary. It has been said that the Gospel is not merely something to come to church to hear but something to go from the church to tell—and we are all appointed to tell it. It has also been said, “Christianity began as a company of lay witnesses; it has become a professional pulpitism, financed by lay spectators!” Nowadays we hire a church staff to do “full-time Christian work,” and we sit in church on Sunday to watch them do it. Every Christian is meant to be in full-time Christian service … There is indeed a special ministry of pastors, teachers and evangelists—but for what? … For the perfecting of the saints for their ministry.<a id="calibre_link-96" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-10">27</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">These divinely given men should not serve in such a way as to make people perpetually dependent on them. Instead, they should work toward the day when the saints will be able to carry on by themselves. We might illustrate this as follows:</p>
      <div id="calibre_link-150" class="figure">
        <p class="fig"><img src="00000.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre10"/></p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft">The circle in the center depicts, let us say, the gift of a teacher. He ministers to those in the circle around him so that they are equipped, that is, built up in the faith. Then they go forth and minister to others according to the gifts God has given them. In this way the church grows and expands. It is the divine method of producing growth in <b class="calibre5">the body of Christ</b>, both in size and spirituality.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Limitation of Christian service to a select class of men hinders the development of God’s people, stifles the cause of world evangelism, and stunts the growth of the church. The distinction between clergy and laity is unscriptural and perhaps the greatest single hindrance to the spread of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:13</span> Verse 13 answers the question, “How long will this growth process continue?” The answer is <b class="calibre5">till we all come to</b> a state of <b class="calibre5">unity</b>, maturity, and conformity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Unity</span>. When the Lord takes His church home to heaven, we will all arrive at <b class="calibre5">the unity of the faith</b>. “Now we see in a mirror dimly” with regard to many matters. We have differences of opinion on a host of subjects. Then we will all be fully agreed. And we will reach <b class="calibre5">the unity of … the knowledge of the Son of God</b>. Here we have individual views of the Lord, of what He is like, of the implications of His teachings. Then we will see Him as He is, and know as we are known.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Maturity</span>. At the Rapture we will also reach full growth or maturity. Both as individuals and as the Body of Christ, we will achieve perfection of spiritual development.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Conformity</span>. And we will be conformed to Him. Everyone will be morally like <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. And the universal church will be a full-grown Body, perfectly suited to its glorious Head. “The fulness of Christ is the Church itself, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all” (FWG). <b class="calibre5">The measure of the stature</b> of the church means its complete development, the fulfillment of God’s plan for its growth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:14</span> When the gifts operate in their God-appointed manner, and the saints are active in service for the Lord, three dangers are avoided—immaturity, instability, and gullibility.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Immaturity</span>. Believers who never become involved in aggressive service for Christ never emerge from being spiritual <b class="calibre5">children</b>. They are undeveloped through lack of exercise. It was to such that the writer to the Hebrews said, “For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again….” (Heb. 5:12).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Instability</span>. Another danger is spiritual fickleness. Immature Christians are susceptible to the grotesque novelties and fads of professional quacks. They become religious gypsies, moving <b class="calibre5">to and fro</b> from one appealing fantasy to another.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Gullibility</span>. Most serious of all is the danger of deception. Those who are babes are unskillful in the word of righteousness, their senses are not exercised to discern between good and evil (Heb. 5:13, 14). They inevitably meet some false cultist who impresses them by his zeal and apparent sincerity. Because he uses religious words, they think he must be a true Christian. If they had studied the Bible for themselves, they would be able to see through his deceitful juggling of words. But now they are <b class="calibre5">carried about</b> by his <b class="calibre5">wind of doctrine</b> and led by unprincipled <b class="calibre5">cunning</b> into a form of systematized error.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:15</span> The last two verses in the paragraph describe the proper process of growth in the Body of Christ. First, there is the necessity of doctrinal adherence: <b class="calibre5">but, speaking the truth</b>…. There can be no compromise as to the fundamentals of the faith. Second, there must be a right spirit: <b class="calibre5">but, speaking the truth in love</b>. If it is spoken in any other way, the result is a one-sided testimony. Blaikie admonishes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Truth is the element in which we are to live, move, and have our being…. But truth must be inseparably married to love; good tidings spoken harshly are not good tidings. The charm of the message is destroyed by the discordant spirit of the messenger.<a id="calibre_link-97" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-11">28</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Then as the gifts equip the saints, and as the saints engage in active service, they <b class="calibre5">grow up in all things into</b> Christ. Christ is the aim and object of their growth, and the sphere of growth is <b class="calibre5">in all things</b>. In every area of their lives they become more like <b class="calibre5">Him</b>. As the Head has His way in the church, His Body will give an ever more accurate representation of Him to the world!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:16</span> The Lord Jesus is not only the goal of growth, He is the source of growth as well. <b class="calibre5">From</b> Him <b class="calibre5">the whole body</b> is involved in the <b class="calibre5">growth</b> process. The marvelous integration of the members of the Body is described by the phrase <b class="calibre5">joined and knit together</b>. This means that every member is exactly designed for his own place and function, and perfectly <b class="calibre5">joined</b> to every other member so as to make a complete, living organism. The importance, yes, the indispensability of every member is next indicated: <b class="calibre5">joined and knit together by what every joint supplies</b>. The human body consists primarily of bones, organs, and flesh. The bones are bound together by joints and ligaments, and the organs also are attached by ligaments. Each joint and ligament fulfills a role in the growth and usefulness of the body. So it is in <b class="calibre5">the body</b> of Christ. No member is superficial; even the most humble believer is necessary.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As each believer fulfills his proper role, <b class="calibre5">the body</b> grows as a harmonious, well-articulated unit. In a very real sense, <b class="calibre5">the body causes growth of the body</b>, paradoxical as it sounds. This simply means that <b class="calibre5">growth</b> is stimulated by <b class="calibre5">the body</b> itself as the members feed on the Bible, pray, worship, and witness for Christ. As Chafer said, “The Church, like the human body, is self-developing.” In addition to growth in size, there is a building up <b class="calibre5">of itself in love</b>. This speaks of the mutual concern of the members for one another. As Christians abide in Christ and fulfill their proper function in the church, they grow closer to one another <b class="calibre5">in love</b> and unity.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-130" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-12">C. Appeal for a New Morality (4:17—5:21)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:17</span> Here begins the apostle’s eloquent appeal for a new morality, an appeal which extends to 5:21. Testifying <b class="calibre5">in the Lord</b>, that is, by authority of <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b> and by divine inspiration, he urges the Christians to put off every trace of their past life, as if it were a muddy coat, and to put on the virtues and excellencies of the Lord Jesus Christ. <b class="calibre5">You should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk</b>. They were no longer <b class="calibre5">Gentiles</b>; they were Christians. There should be a corresponding change in their lives. Paul saw the Christless world of the nations sunk in ignorance and degradation. Seven terrible things characterized them. They were:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Aimless</span>. They walked <b class="calibre5">in the futility of their mind</b>. Their life was empty, purposeless, and fruitless. There was great activity but no progress. They chased bubbles and shadows, and neglected the great realities of life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:18</span> <span class="bi">Blind</span>. “They live blindfold in a world of illusion” (JBP). <b class="calibre5">Their understanding</b> was <b class="calibre5">darkened</b>. First, they had a native incapacity to understand spiritual truths, and then, because of their rejection of the knowledge of the true God, they suffered blindness as a judgment from the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Ungodly</span>. They were <b class="calibre5">alienated from the life of God</b>, or at a great distance from Him. This was brought about by their willful, deep-seated ignorance and by the hardness of their hearts. They had rejected the light of God in creation and in conscience, and had turned to idolatry. Thereafter they had plunged farther and farther from God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:19</span> <span class="bi">Shameless</span>. They were <b class="calibre5">past feeling</b>. W. C. Wright explains:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Moule translates it: “having got over the pain.” How expressive! When conscience is at first denied, there is a twinge of pain; there is a protest that can be heard. But if the voice is silenced, presently the voice becomes less clear and clamant; the protest is smothered; the twinge is less acute, until at last it is possible to “get over the pain.”<a id="calibre_link-98" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-13">29</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Sordid</span>. They consciously gave <b class="calibre5">themselves over to lewdness</b>, that is, to vile forms of behavior. The cardinal sin of the Gentiles was and still is sexual immorality. They descended to unparalleled depths of depravity; the walls of Pompeii tell the story of shame and lost decency. The same sins characterize the Gentile world today.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Indecent</span>. In their sexual sin, they worked <b class="calibre5">all uncleanness</b>. There is a suggestion here that they gave themselves up to every kind of <b class="calibre5">uncleanness</b> as if they were carrying on a trade or business in <b class="calibre5">lewdness</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Insatiable</span>. <b class="calibre5">With greediness</b>. They were never satisfied. They never had enough. Their sin created an enormous appetite for more of the same thing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:20</span> How different all this was from the <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> whom the Ephesians had come to know and love! He was the personification of purity and chastity. He knew no sin, He did no sin, there was no sin in Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:21</span> The <b class="calibre5">if</b> in <b class="calibre5">if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him</b> is not meant to cast doubt on the conversion of the Ephesians. It simply emphasizes that all those who had <b class="calibre5">heard</b> Christ and had <b class="calibre5">been taught by Him</b> had come to know Him as the essence of holiness and godliness. To have heard Christ means to have <b class="calibre5">heard Him</b> with the hearing of faith—to have accepted Him as Lord and Savior. The expression <b class="calibre5">taught by Him</b> refers to the instruction the Ephesians received as they walked in fellowship with Him subsequent to their conversion. Blaikie remarks: “All truth acquires a different hue and a different character when there is a personal relation to Jesus. Truth apart from the Person of Christ has little power.”<a id="calibre_link-99" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-14">30</a> <b class="calibre5">As the truth is in Jesus</b>. He not only teaches the truth; He is truth incarnate (John 14:6). The name <b class="calibre5">Jesus</b> takes us back to His life on earth, since that is His name in Incarnation. In that spotless life which He lived as a Man in this world, we see the very antithesis of the walk of the Gentiles which Paul has just described.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:22</span> In the school of Christ we learn that at the time of conversion we put away our <b class="calibre5">old man which grows corrupt</b> through <b class="calibre5">deceitful lusts</b>. <b class="calibre5">The old man</b> means all that a person was before his conversion, all that he was as a child of Adam. It is corrupted as a result of giving in to <b class="calibre5">deceitful</b>, evil cravings which are pleasant and promising in anticipation but hideous and disappointing in retrospect. As far as his position in Christ is concerned, the believer’s <b class="calibre5">old man</b> was crucified and buried with Christ. In practice, the believer should reckon it to be dead. Here Paul is emphasizing the positional side of the truth—we have <b class="calibre5">put off the old man</b> once for all.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:23</span> A second lesson the Ephesians learned at the feet of Jesus was that they were being <b class="calibre5">renewed in the spirit of</b> their <b class="calibre5">mind</b>. This points to a complete about-face in their thinking, a change from mental impurity to holiness. The Spirit of God influences the thought processes to reason from God’s standpoint, not from that of unsaved men.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:24</span> The third lesson is that they had <b class="calibre5">put on the new man</b> once for all. <b class="calibre5">The new man</b> is what a believer is in Christ. It is the new creation, in which old things have passed away and all things have become new (2 Cor. 5:17). This <b class="calibre5">new</b> kind of <b class="calibre5">man</b> is <b class="calibre5">according to God</b>, that is, <b class="calibre5">created</b> in His likeness. And it manifests itself <b class="calibre5">in true righteousness and holiness</b>. <b class="calibre5">Righteousness</b> means right conduct toward others. <b class="calibre5">Holiness</b> is “piety towards God, which puts Him in His place,” as F. W. Grant defines it.<a id="calibre_link-100" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-15">31</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:25</span> Paul now moves from the believer’s standing to their state. Because they have put off the old man and have put on the new man through their union with Christ, they should demonstrate this startling reversal in their everyday lives.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">They can do this, first, by <b class="calibre5">putting away lying</b> and putting on truthfulness. <b class="calibre5">Lying</b> here includes every form of dishonesty, whether it is shading of the truth, exaggeration, cheating, failure to keep promises, betrayal of confidence, flattery, or fudging on income taxes. The Christian’s word should be absolutely trustworthy. His yes should mean yes, and his no, no. The life of a Christian becomes a libel rather than a Bible when he stoops to any form of tampering with truthfulness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Truth is a debt we owe to all men. However, when Paul uses the word <b class="calibre5">neighbor</b>, here, he is thinking particularly of our fellow believers. This is clear from the motive given: <b class="calibre5">for we are members of one another</b> (cf. Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12–27). It is as unthinkable for one Christian to lie to another as it would be for a nerve in the body to deliberately send a false message to the brain, or for the eye to deceive the rest of the body when danger is approaching.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:26</span> A second area for practical renewal in our lives is in connection with sinful <b class="calibre5">wrath</b> and righteous anger. There are times when a believer may be righteously <b class="calibre5">angry</b>, for instance, when the character of God is impugned. In such cases anger is commanded: <b class="calibre5">Be angry</b>. Anger against evil can be righteous. But there are other times when anger is sinful. When it is an emotion of malice, jealousy, resentment, vindictiveness, or hatred because of personal wrongs, it is forbidden. Aristotle said, “Anybody can become angry—that is easy; but to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is <i class="calibre3">not</i> easy.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If a believer gives way to unrighteous <b class="calibre5">wrath</b>, he should confess and forsake it quickly. Confession should be made both to God and to the victim of his anger. There should be no nursing of grudges, no harboring of resentments, no carrying over of irritations. <b class="calibre5">Do not let the sun go down on your wrath</b>. Anything that mars fellowship with God or with our brethren should immediately be made right.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:27</span> Unconfessed sins of temper provide <b class="calibre5">the devil</b> with a foothold or a base of operations. He is capable of finding plenty of these without our deliberately helping him. Therefore, we must not excuse malice, wrath, envy, hatred, or passion in our lives. These sins discredit the Christian testimony, stumble the unsaved, offend believers, and harm us spiritually and physically.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:28</span> Now Paul turns his attention to the contrasting behavior patterns of stealing and sharing. The old man steals; the new man shares. Put off the old; put on the new! The fact that Paul would ever address such instruction as <b class="calibre5">“Let him who stole steal no longer”</b> to believers disproves any notion that Christians are sinlessly perfect. They still have the old, evil, selfish nature that must be reckoned dead in daily experience. Stealing may take many forms—all the way from grand larceny to nonpayment of debts, to witnessing for Christ on the employer’s time, to plagiarism, to the use of false measurements, and to falsifying expense accounts. Of course, this prohibition against stealing is not new. The Law of Moses forbade theft (Ex. 20:15). It is what follows that makes the passage distinctively Christian. Not only should we refrain from stealing, we should actually <b class="calibre5">labor</b> in an honorable occupation in order to be able to share with others who are less fortunate. Grace, not law, is the power of holiness. Only the positive power of grace can turn a thief into a philanthropist.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is radical and revolutionary. The natural approach is for men to work for the supply of their own needs and desires. When their income rises, their standard of living rises. Everything in their lives revolves around self. This verse suggests a nobler, more exalted view of secular employment. It is a means of supplying a modest standard of living for one’s family, but also of alleviating human <b class="calibre5">need</b>, spiritual and temporal, at home and abroad. And how vast that <b class="calibre5">need</b> is!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:29</span> The apostle now turns to the subject of speech, and contrasts that which is worthless with that which edifies. <b class="calibre5">Corrupt</b> speech generally means conversation that is filthy and suggestive; this would include off-color jokes, profanity, and dirty stories. But here it probably has the wider sense of any form of conversation that is frivolous, empty, idle, and worthless. Paul deals with obscene and vile language in 5:4; here he is telling us to abandon profitless speech and substitute constructive conversation. The Christian’s speech should be:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Edifying</span>. It should result in building up the hearers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Appropriate</span>. It should be suitable to the occasion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Gracious</span>. It should <b class="calibre5">impart grace to the hearers</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:30</span> <b class="calibre5">And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</b> If this is taken in connection with the preceding verse, it means that worthless talk grieves the Spirit. It may also be linked to verses 25–28 to indicate that lying, unrighteous anger, and stealing also hurt Him. Or in a still wider sense, it may be saying that we should abstain from anything and everything that grieves Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Three powerful reasons are suggested:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. He is the <i class="calibre3">Holy</i> Spirit. Anything that is not holy is distasteful to Him.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. He is the Holy Spirit of <b class="calibre5">God</b>, a member of the blessed Trinity.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. We <b class="calibre5">were sealed</b> by Him <b class="calibre5">for the day of redemption</b>. As mentioned previously, a seal speaks of ownership and security. He is the seal that guarantees our preservation until Christ returns for us and our salvation is complete. Interestingly enough, Paul here uses the eternal security of the believer as one of the strongest reasons why we should <i class="calibre3">not</i> sin.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">The fact that He can be grieved shows that the Holy Spirit is a Person, not a mere influence. It also means He loves us, because only a person who loves can be grieved. The favorite ministry of God’s Spirit is to glorify Christ and to change the believer into His likeness (2 Cor. 3:18). When a Christian sins, He has to turn from this ministry to one of restoration. It grieves Him to see the believer’s spiritual progress interrupted by sin. He must then lead the Christian to the place of repentance and confession of sin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:31</span> All sins of temper and tongue should be put away. The apostle lists several of them. Though it is not possible to distinguish each one precisely, the overall meaning is clear:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Bitterness</b>—Smoldering resentment, unwillingness to forgive, harsh feeling.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Wrath</b>—Bursts of rage, violent passion, temper tantrums.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Anger</b>—Grouchiness, animosity, hostility.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Clamor</b>—Loud outcries of anger, bawling, angry bickering, shouting down of opponents.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Evil speaking</b>—Insulting language, slander, abusive speech.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Malice</b>—Wishing evil on others, spite, meanness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:32</span> The foregoing sins of temper should be terminated, but the vacuum must be filled by the cultivation of Christlike qualities. The former are natural vices; the following are supernatural virtues:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Kindness</span>—An unselfish concern for the welfare of others, and a desire to be helpful even at great personal sacrifice.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Tenderheartedness</span>—A sympathetic, affectionate, and compassionate interest in others, and a willingness to bear their burden.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="bi">Forgiveness</span>—A readiness to pardon offenses, to overlook personal wrongs against oneself, and to harbor no desire for retaliation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The greatest example of One who forgives is God Himself. The basis of His forgiveness is the work of Christ at Calvary. And we are the unworthy objects. God could not forgive sin without proper satisfaction being made. In His love He provided the satisfaction which His righteousness demanded. <b class="calibre5">In Christ</b>, that is, in His Person and work, God found a righteous basis on which He could forgive us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Since He forgave us when we were in debt “millions of dollars,” we ought to forgive others when they owe us “a few dollars” (Matt. 18:23–28 JBP). Lenski counsels:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The moment a man wrongs me I must forgive him. Then <i class="calibre3">my</i> soul is free. If I hold the wrong against him I sin against God and against him and jeopardize my forgiveness with God. Whether the man repents, makes amends, asks my pardon or not, makes no difference. I have instantly forgiven him. He must face God with the wrong he has done; but that is his affair and God’s and not mine save that I should help him according to Matt. 18:15, etc. But whether this succeeds or not and before this even begins, I must forgive him.<a id="calibre_link-101" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-16">32</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:1</span> God’s example of forgiveness in 4:32 forms the basis of Paul’s exhortation here. The connection is this: God in Christ has forgiven you. Now <b class="calibre5">be imitators of God</b> in forgiving one another. A special motive is appended in the words, <b class="calibre5">as dear children</b>. In natural life, children bear the family likeness and should seek to uphold the family name. In spiritual life, we should manifest our Father to the world and seek to walk worthy of our dignity as His beloved <b class="calibre5">children.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:2</span> Another way in which we should resemble the Lord is by walking <b class="calibre5">in love</b>. The rest of the verse explains that to <b class="calibre5">walk in love</b> means to give ourselves for others. This is what Christ, our perfect Example, did. Amazing fact! He loved us. The proof of His love is that He gave Himself for us in death at Calvary.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">His gift is described as <b class="calibre5">an offering and a sacrifice to God</b>. <b class="calibre5">An offering</b> is anything given to God; <b class="calibre5">a sacrifice</b> here includes the additional element of death. He was the true burnt <b class="calibre5">offering</b>, the One who was completely devoted to do the will of God, even to the death of the cross. His <b class="calibre5">sacrifice</b> of unspeakable devotion is eulogized as being <b class="calibre5">for a sweet-smelling aroma</b>. F. B. Meyer comments,</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">In love so measureless, so reckless of cost, for those who were naturally so unworthy of it, there was a spectacle which filled heaven with fragrance and God’s heart with joy.<a id="calibre_link-102" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-17">33</a></p>

      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:3</span> In verses 3 and 4 the apostle reverts to the topic of sexual sins and decisively calls for saintly separation from them. First, he mentions various forms of sexual immorality:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Fornication</b>. Whenever it is mentioned in the same verse as adultery, <b class="calibre5">fornication</b> means illicit intercourse among <i class="calibre3">unmarried</i> persons. However, when, as here, the word is not distinguished from adultery, it probably refers to <i class="calibre3">any</i> form of sexual immorality, and the NKJV usually so translates it. (Our word “pornography,” literally, “whore-writing,” is related to the word translated <b class="calibre5">fornication</b>.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Uncleanness</b>. This too may mean immoral acts, but perhaps it can also include impure pictures, obscene books, and other suggestive materials that go along with lives of indecency and that feed the fires of passion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Covetousness</b>. While we generally think of this as meaning the lust for money, here it refers to sensual desire—the insatiable greed to satisfy one’s sexual appetite outside the bounds of marriage. (See Ex. 20:17: “You shall not covet … your neighbor’s wife….”)</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These things should <b class="calibre5">not even be named among</b> Christians. It goes without saying that they should never have to be named as <i class="calibre3">having been committed</i> by believers. They should not even be <i class="calibre3">discussed</i> in any way that might lessen their sinful and shameful character. There is always the greatest danger in speaking lightly of them, making excuses for them, or even discussing them familiarly and continually. Paul accents his exhortation with the phrase <b class="calibre5">as is fitting for saints</b>. Believers have been separated from the corruption that is in the world; now they should live in practical separation from dark passion, both in deed and word.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:4</span> Their speech should also be free from every trace of:</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Filthiness</b>. This refers to dirty stories, suggestive jokes with a sexual coloring, and all forms of obscenity and indecency.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Foolish talking</b>. This means empty conversation that is worthy of a moron. Here it may include gutter language.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Coarse jesting</b>. This means jokes or talk with unsavory, hidden meanings. To talk about something, to joke about it, to make it a frequent subject of conversation is to introduce it into your mind, and to bring you closer to actually doing it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is always dangerous to joke about sin. Instead of using his tongue for such unworthy and unbecoming talk, the Christian should deliberately cultivate the practice of expressing <b class="calibre5">thanks</b> to God for all the blessings and mercies of life. This is pleasing to the Lord, a good example to others, and beneficial to one’s own soul.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:5</span> There is no room for doubt as to God’s attitude toward immoral persons: they have no <b class="calibre5">inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God</b>. This verdict is in sharp contrast to the world’s current attitude that sex offenders are sick and need psychiatric treatment. Men say immorality is a sickness; God calls it sin. Men condone it; God condemns it. Men say the answer is psychoanalysis; God says the answer is regeneration.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Three offenders are specified, the same three found in verse 3—the <b class="calibre5">fornicator</b>, the <b class="calibre5">unclean person</b>, and the <b class="calibre5">covetous man</b>. Here the thought is added that a <b class="calibre5">covetous</b> person <b class="calibre5">is an idolater</b>. One reason he <b class="calibre5">is an idolater</b> is that he has a false impression of what God is like: his concept of God is a Being who approves sensual greed, otherwise, he would not dare be covetous. Another reason why covetousness is idolatry is that it puts the person’s own will above the will of God. A third reason is that it results in the worship of the creature rather than the Creator (Rom. 1:25).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When Paul says that such persons have no <b class="calibre5">inheritance in the kingdom</b>, he means precisely that. People whose lives are characterized by these sins are lost, are in their sins, and are on the way to hell. They are not in the invisible <b class="calibre5">kingdom</b> at the present time; they will not be in <b class="calibre5">the kingdom</b> when Christ returns to reign; and they will be forever shut out from the everlasting <b class="calibre5">kingdom</b> in heaven. The apostle is not saying these are people who, though they are in <b class="calibre5">the kingdom</b>, will suffer loss at the Judgment Seat of Christ. The subject is salvation, not rewards. They may profess to be Christians, but they prove by their lives that they were never saved. They <i class="calibre3">can</i> be saved, of course, by repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus. But if they are genuinely converted, they will no longer practice these sins.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that the deity of Christ is implied in the expression <b class="calibre5">the kingdom of Christ and God</b>. <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> is put on an equal level with <b class="calibre5">God</b> the Father as Ruler in <b class="calibre5">the kingdom.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:6</span> Many people of the world adopt an increasingly lenient and tolerant attitude toward sexual immorality. They say the gratification of bodily appetites is needful and beneficial, and that their repression produces warped, inhibited personalities. They say morals are entirely a matter of the culture in which we live, and that since “pre-marital,” “extra-marital,” and “gay” sex (which God’s word condemns as fornication, adultery, and perversion) are accepted in our culture, they ought to be legalized. Surprisingly enough, some of the leading spokesmen in favor of making sexual sins acceptable are men who hold high positions in the professing church. Thus, the laymen who always thought immorality was immoral are now being assured by prominent clergymen that such an attitude is passé.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christians should not be hoodwinked by such double talk. <b class="calibre5">Because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience</b>. The Lord’s attitude toward such sins as fornication and adultery was seen in Numbers 25:1–9: twenty-four thousand Israelites were slain because they sinned with the women of Moab. The Lord’s attitude toward homosexuality was displayed when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by brimstone and fire from heaven (Gen. 19:24, 28).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But God’s <b class="calibre5">wrath</b> is displayed not only in such supernatural acts of punishment. Those who practice sexual sins experience His judgment in other ways. There are physical effects, such as venereal disease and AIDS. There are mental, nervous, and emotional disorders arising from a sense of guilt. There are changes in the personality—the effeminate often becomes even more so (Rom. 1:27). And of course there will be the final, eternal judgment of God on fornicators and adulterers (Heb. 13:4). No mercy will be shown to <b class="calibre5">sons of disobedience</b>—to those who are descended from disobedient Adam and who willfully follow him in disobeying God (Rev. 21:8).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:7</span> Believers are solemnly warned to have no part in such ungodly behavior. To do so is to dishonor the name of Christ, to wreck other lives, to ruin one’s own testimony, and to invite a torrent of retribution.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:8</span> To enforce his urgent imperative in verse 7, the apostle now gives a pithy discourse on <b class="calibre5">darkness</b> and <b class="calibre5">light</b> (vv. 8–14). The Ephesians <b class="calibre5">were once darkness, but now</b> they <b class="calibre5">are light in the Lord</b>. Paul does not say they were <i class="calibre3">in</i> the darkness, but that they themselves <i class="calibre3">were</i> the personification of <b class="calibre5">darkness</b>. Now, through union with the Lord, they have become <b class="calibre5">light</b>. He is light; they are in Him; so <b class="calibre5">now</b> they <b class="calibre5">are light in the Lord</b>. Their state should henceforth correspond with their standing. They should <b class="calibre5">walk as children of light</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:9</span> This parenthesis explains the type of <b class="calibre5">fruit</b> produced by those who walk in the light.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The fruit of the Spirit</b><a id="calibre_link-103" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-18">34</a> consists of <b class="calibre5">all</b> forms of <b class="calibre5">goodness, righteousness, and truth</b>. <b class="calibre5">Goodness</b> here is an inclusive term for all moral excellence. <b class="calibre5">Righteousness</b> means integrity in all dealings with God and men. <b class="calibre5">Truth</b> is honesty, equity, and reality. Put them all together and you have the light of a Christ-filled life shining out in a scene of dismal darkness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:10</span> Those who walk in the light not only produce the type of fruit listed in the preceding verse, but also find <b class="calibre5">out what is acceptable to the Lord</b>. They put every thought, word, and action to the test. What does <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b> think about this? How does it appear in His presence? Every area of life comes under the searchlight—conversation, standard of living, clothes, books, business, pleasures, entertainments, furniture, friendships, vacations, cars, and sports.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:11</span> Believers should <b class="calibre5">have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness</b>, either by participation or by any attitude that might indicate tolerance or leniency. These <b class="calibre5">works of darkness</b> are <b class="calibre5">unfruitful</b> as far as God and men are concerned. It was this feature of utter barrenness that once prompted Paul to ask the Roman Christians, “What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed?” (Rom. 6:21). Then too they are <b class="calibre5">works of darkness</b>: they belong to the world of dim lights, drawn drapes, locked doors, secret rooms. They reflect man’s natural preference for <b class="calibre5">darkness</b> and his abhorrence of light when his deeds are evil (John 3:19). The believer is called not only to abstain from <b class="calibre5">the unfruitful works of darkness</b>, but positively he is called to <b class="calibre5">expose them</b>. He does this in two ways: first, by a life of holiness, and second, by words of correction spoken under the direction of the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:12</span> Now the apostle explains why the Christian must have no complicity with moral corruption and must rebuke it. The vile sins which people commit in secret are so debased that <b class="calibre5">it is shameful even to</b> mention them, let alone commit them. The unnatural forms of sin which man has invented are so bad that even to describe them would defile the minds of those who listened. So the Christian is taught to refrain from even talking about them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:13</span> <b class="calibre5">Light makes manifest</b> whatever is in the darkness. So a holy Christian life reveals by contrast the sinfulness of unregenerate lives. And appropriate words of rebuke reveal sin in its true character also. Blaikie illustrates:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">As, for instance, when our Lord reproved the hypocrisy of the Pharisees—their practices had not seemed to the disciples very evil before, but when Christ threw on them the pure light of truth, they were made manifest in their true character—they appeared and they still appear, odious.<a id="calibre_link-104" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-19">35</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The latter part of verse 13 may better read: <b class="calibre5">for whatever</b> <i class="calibre3">is made</i> <b class="calibre5">manifest is light</b>.<a id="calibre_link-105" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-20">36</a> This simply means that when Christians exercise their ministry as light, others are brought to the light. Wicked men are transformed into children of light through the reproving ministry of <b class="calibre5">light</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is not a rule without exceptions, of course. Not everyone who is exposed to the light becomes a Christian. But it is a general principle in the spiritual realm that light has a way of reproducing itself. We find an illustration of the principle in 1 Peter 3:1, where believing wives are taught to win their unbelieving husbands to Christ by the example of their lives: “Wives, likewise, be submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives.” Thus the light of Christian wives triumphs over the darkness of heathen husbands, and the latter become light.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:14</span> The life of the believer should always be preaching a sermon, should always be exposing the surrounding darkness, should always be extending this invitation to unbelievers:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf"><b class="calibre5">“Awake, you who sleep,</b></p>
        <p class="sl"><b class="calibre5">Arise from the dead,</b></p>
        <p class="sll"><b class="calibre5">And Christ will give you light.”</b></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">This is the voice of light speaking to those who are sleeping in darkness and lying in spiritual death. The light calls them to life and illumination. If they answer the invitation, <b class="calibre5">Christ will</b> shine on them and <b class="calibre5">give</b> them <b class="calibre5">light.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:15</span> In the next seven verses, Paul contrasts foolish footsteps and careful conduct by a series of negative and positive exhortations. The first is a general plea to his readers to <b class="calibre5">walk not as fools but as wise</b>. As mentioned previously, <b class="calibre5">walk</b> is one of the key words of the Epistle: It is mentioned seven times to describe “the whole round of the activities of the individual life.” To <b class="calibre5">walk circumspectly</b> is to live in the light of our position as God’s children. To <b class="calibre5">walk as fools</b> means to descend from this high plane to the conduct of worldly men.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:16</span> The walk of wisdom calls us to redeem <b class="calibre5">the time</b> or buy up the opportunities. Every day brings its opened doors, its vast potential. <b class="calibre5">Redeeming the time</b> means living lives noted for holiness, deeds of mercy, and words of help. What lends special urgency to this matter is the <b class="calibre5">evil</b> character of <b class="calibre5">the days</b> in which we live. They remind us God will not always strive with man, the day of grace will soon close, the opportunities for worship, witness, and service on earth will soon be forever ended.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:17</span> So we should <b class="calibre5">not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is</b>. This is crucial. Because of the abounding evil and the shortness of the time, we might be tempted to spend our days in frantic and feverish activity of our own choosing. But this would amount to nothing but wasted energy. The important thing is to find out God’s <b class="calibre5">will</b> for us each day and do it. This is the only way to be efficient and effective. It is all too possible to carry on Christian work according to our own ideas and in our own strength, and be completely out of <b class="calibre5">the will of the Lord</b>. The path of wisdom is to discern God’s <b class="calibre5">will</b> for our individual lives, then to obey it to the hilt.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:18</span> <b class="calibre5">And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation</b>. In our North American culture, such a command seems almost shocking and unnecessary, since total abstinence is the rule among so many Christians. But we must remember that the Bible was written for believers in all cultures, and in many countries wine is still a fairly common beverage on the table. The Scriptures do not condemn the use of wine, but they do condemn its abuse. The use of wine as a medicine is recommended (Prov. 31:6; 1 Tim. 5:23). The Lord Jesus made wine for use as a beverage at the wedding in Cana of Galilee (John 2:1–11).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But the use of wine becomes abuse under the following circumstances and is then forbidden:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. When it leads to excess (Prov. 23:29–35).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. When it becomes habit-forming (1 Cor. 6:12b).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. When it offends the weak conscience of another believer (Rom. 14:13; 1 Cor. 8:9).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="4">4. When it hurts a Christian’s testimony in the community and is therefore not to the glory of God (1 Cor. 10:31).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="5">5. When there is any doubt in the Christian’s mind about it (Rom. 14:23).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul’s recommended alternative to being <b class="calibre5">drunk with wine</b> is being <b class="calibre5">filled with the Spirit</b>. This connection too may startle us at first, but when we compare and contrast the two states, we see why the apostle links them in this way.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First, there are certain similarities:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. In both conditions, the person is under a power outside himself. In one case it is the power of intoxicating liquor (sometimes called “spirits”); in the other case it is the power of <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b>.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. In both conditions, the person is fervent. On the Day of Pentecost, the fervency produced by <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b> was mistaken for that produced by new wine (Acts 2:13).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. In both conditions, the person’s walk is affected—his physical walk in the case of drunkenness and his moral behavior in the other instance.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">But there are two ways in which the two conditions present sharp contrasts:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. In the case of drunkenness, there is <b class="calibre5">dissipation</b> and debauchery. The Spirit’s filling never produces these.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="2">2. In the case of drunkenness, there is loss of self-control. But the fruit of <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b> is self-control (Gal. 5:23). A believer who is filled <b class="calibre5">with the Spirit</b> is never transported outside himself where he can no longer control his actions; the spirit of a prophet is always subject to the prophet (1 Cor. 14:32).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Sometimes in the Bible, the filling <b class="calibre5">with the Spirit</b> seems to be presented as a sovereign gift of God. For instance, John the Baptist was <b class="calibre5">filled with the</b> Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> from his mother’s womb (Luke 1:15). In such a case, the person receives it without any prior conditions to be met. It is not something for which he works or prays; the Lord gives it as He pleases. Here in Ephesians 5:18 the believer is <i class="calibre3">commanded</i> to <b class="calibre5">be filled with the Spirit</b>. It involves action on his part. He must meet certain conditions. It is not automatic but the result of obedience.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For this reason the Spirit’s filling should be distinguished from certain other of His ministries. It is <i class="calibre3">not</i> the same as any of the following functions:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. <i class="calibre3">The baptism</i> by the Holy Spirit. This is the work of the Spirit which incorporates the believer in the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. <i class="calibre3">The indwelling</i>. By this ministry the Comforter takes up His residence in the body of the Christian and empowers him for holiness, worship, and service (John 14:16).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. <i class="calibre3">The anointing</i>. <b class="calibre5">The Spirit</b> Himself is the anointing who teaches the child of God the things of the Lord (1 John 2:27).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. <i class="calibre3">The earnest</i> and <i class="calibre3">the seal</i>. We have already seen that the Holy Spirit as the earnest guarantees the inheritance for the saint, and as the seal He guarantees the saint for the inheritance (Eph. 1:13, 14).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">These are some of the ministries of the Spirit which are realized in a person the moment he is saved. Everyone who is in Christ automatically has the baptism, the indwelling, the anointing, the earnest, and the seal.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But the filling is different. It is not a once-for-all crisis experience in the life of a disciple; rather it is a continuous process. The literal translation of the command is “Be being filled with the Spirit.” It may begin as a crisis experience, but it must continue thereafter as a moment-by-moment process. Today’s filling will not do for tomorrow. And certainly it is a state greatly to be desired. In fact, it is the ideal condition of the believer on earth. It means that the Holy Spirit is having His way relatively ungrieved in the life of the Christian, and that the believer is therefore fulfilling his role in the plan of God for that time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">How then can a believer <b class="calibre5">be filled with the Spirit</b>? The Apostle Paul does not tell us here in Ephesians; he merely commands us to <b class="calibre5">be filled</b>. But from other parts of the word, we know that in order to <b class="calibre5">be filled with the Spirit</b> we must:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Confess and put away all known sin in our lives (1 John 1:5–9). It is obvious that such a holy Person cannot work freely in a life where sin is condoned.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Yield ourselves completely to His control (Rom. 12:1, 2). This involves the surrender of our will, our intellect, our body, our time, our talents, and our treasures. Every area of life must be thrown open to His dominion.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. Let the word of Christ dwell in us richly (Col. 3:16). This involves reading the word, studying it, and obeying it. When the word of Christ dwells in us richly, the same results follow (Col. 3:16) as follow the filling of <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b> (Eph. 5:19).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. Finally, we must be emptied of self (Gal. 2:20). To be filled with a new ingredient, a cup must first be emptied of the old. To <b class="calibre5">be filled with</b> <i class="calibre3">Him</i>, we must first be emptied of <i class="calibre3">us</i>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="paft">An unknown author writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Just as you have left the whole burden of your sin, and have rested on the finished work of Christ, so leave the whole burden of your life and service, and rest upon the present inworking of the Holy Spirit. Give yourself up, morning by morning, to be led by the Holy Spirit and go forth praising and at rest, leaving Him to manage you and your day. Cultivate the habit all through the day, of joyfully depending upon and obeying Him, expecting Him to guide, to enlighten, to reprove, to teach, to use, and to do in and with you what He wills. Count upon His working as a fact, altogether apart from sight or feeling. Only let us believe in and obey the Holy Spirit as the Ruler of our lives, and cease from the burden of trying to manage ourselves; then shall the fruit of the Spirit appear in us as He wills to the glory of God.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Does a person know it when he is <b class="calibre5">filled with the Spirit</b>? Actually, the closer we are to the Lord, the more we are conscious of our own complete unworthiness and sinfulness (Isa. 6:1–5). In His presence, we find nothing in ourselves to be proud of (Luke 5:8). We are not aware of any spiritual superiority over others, any sense of “having arrived.” The believer who is <b class="calibre5">filled with the Spirit</b> is occupied with Christ and not with self.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">At the same time, he may have a realization that God is working in and through his life. He sees things happen in a supernatural way. Circumstances click miraculously. Lives are touched for God. Events move according to a divine timetable. Even forces of nature are on his side; they seem chained to the chariot wheels of the Lord. He sees all this; he realizes that God is working for and through him; and yet he feels strangely detached from it all as far as taking any credit is concerned. In his inmost being, he realizes it is all of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:19</span> Now the apostle gives four results of being filled with the Spirit. First, Spirit-filled Christians speak <b class="calibre5">to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</b>. The divine infilling opens the mouth to talk about the things of the Lord, and enlarges the heart to share these things with others. While some see all three categories as parts of the Book of Psalms, we understand only <b class="calibre5">psalms</b> to mean the inspired writings of David, Asaph, and others. <b class="calibre5">Hymns</b> are noninspired songs which ascribe worship and praise directly to God. <b class="calibre5">Spiritual songs</b> are any other lyrical compositions dealing with spiritual themes, even though not addressed directly to God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A second evidence of the filling is inward joy and praise to God: <b class="calibre5">singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord</b>. The Spirit-filled life is a fountain, bubbling over with joy (Acts 13:52). Zacharias is an illustration: when he was filled with the Holy Spirit, he sang with all his heart to the Lord (Luke 1:67–79).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:20</span> A third result is thanksgiving: <b class="calibre5">giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. Where the Spirit reigns, there is gratitude <b class="calibre5">to God</b>, a deep sense of appreciation, and a spontaneous expression of it. It is not occasional, but continual. Not only for the pleasant things, but for all things. Anyone can be thankful for sunshine; it takes the power of the Spirit to be thankful for the storms of life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The shortest, surest way to all happiness is this:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs"><i class="calibre3">Make it a rule to thank and praise God for everything that happens to you</i>. For it is certain that whatever seeming calamity comes to you, if you thank and praise God for it, you turn it into a blessing. If you could work miracles, you could not do more for yourself than by this thankful spirit: for it needs not a word spoken and turns all that it touches into happiness. (Selected)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:21</span> The fourth test of being Spirit-filled is <b class="calibre5">submitting to one another in the fear of God</b>. Erdman admonishes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">It is a phrase too often neglected…. It names a test of spirituality which Christians too seldom apply…. Many persons feel that shouts of hallelujah and exulting songs and the utterance of praise in more or less “unknown tongues” are all proofs of being “filled with the Spirit.” These all may be spurious and deceitful and without meaning. Submission to our fellow Christians, modesty of demeanor, humility, unwillingness to dispute, forbearance, gentleness—these are the unmistakable proofs of the Spirit’s power…. Such mutual submission to their fellow Christians should be rendered “in the fear of Christ,” that is, in reverence to him who is recognized as the Lord and Master of all.<a id="calibre_link-106" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-21">37</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">These then are four results of the Spirit’s filling—speaking, singing, thanking, and submitting. But there are at least four others:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Boldness in rebuking sin (Acts 13:9–12), and in testifying for the Lord (Acts 4:8–12, 31; 13:52—14:3).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Power for service (Acts 1:8; 6:3, 8; 11:24).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. Generosity, not selfishness (Acts 4:31, 32).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. Exaltation of Christ (Acts 9:17, 20) and of God (Acts 2:4, 11; 10:44, 46).</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">We should earnestly desire to be filled with the Spirit, but only for the glory of God, not for our own glory.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-131" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-22">D. Appeal for Personal Piety in the Christian Household (5:22—6:9)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">5:22</span> Though a new section begins here, there is a close link with the preceding verse. There Paul had listed subjection to one another as one of the results of the divine infilling. In the section from 5:22 to 6:9, he cites three specific areas in the Christian household where submission is the will of God:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ul3f"><span class="bi">Wives</span> should <b class="calibre5">submit to</b> their <span class="bi">own husbands.</span></li>
        <li class="ul2"><i class="calibre3">Children</i> should submit to their <i class="calibre3">parents.</i></li>
        <li class="ul3l"><i class="calibre3">Bondservants</i> should submit to their <i class="calibre3">masters.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">The fact that all believers are one in Christ Jesus does not mean that earthly relationships are abolished. We must still respect the various forms of authority and government which God has instituted. Every well-ordered society rests on two supporting pillars—authority and submission. There must be some who exercise authority and some who submit to that rule. This principle is so basic that it is found even in the Godhead: “But I want you to know that … the head of Christ is God” (1 Cor. 11:3). God ordained human government. No matter how wicked a government may be, yet from God’s standpoint it is better than no government, and we should obey it as far as we can without disobeying or denying the Lord. The absence of government is anarchy, and no society can survive under anarchy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The same is true in the home. There must be a head, and there must be obedience to that head. God ordained that the place of headship be given to the man. He indicated this by creating man first, then creating woman for the man. Thus, both in the order and purpose of creation, He put man in the place of authority and woman in the place of submission.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Submission never implies inferiority. The Lord Jesus is submissive to God the Father, but in no way is He inferior to Him. Neither is the woman inferior to the man. In many ways she may be superior—in devotedness, in sympathy, in diligence, and in heroic endurance. But <b class="calibre5">wives</b> are commanded to <b class="calibre5">submit to</b> their <b class="calibre5">own husbands, as to the Lord</b>. In submitting to the authority of her husband, a wife is submitting to the Lord’s authority. This in itself should remove any attitude of reluctance or rebellion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">History abounds with illustrations of the chaos resulting from disobedience to God’s pattern. By usurping the place of leadership, and acting for her husband, Eve introduced sin into the human race, with all its catastrophic results. In more recent times many of the false cults were started by women who usurped a place of authority which God never intended them to have. Women who leave their God-appointed sphere can wreck a local church, break up a marriage, and destroy a home.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">On the other hand, there is nothing more attractive than a woman fulfilling the role which God has assigned to her. A full-length portrait of such a woman is given in Proverbs 31—an enduring memorial to the wife and mother who pleases the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:23</span> The reason for the wife’s submission is that her <b class="calibre5">husband is</b> her <b class="calibre5">head</b>. He occupies the same relation to her that Christ occupies to the church. <b class="calibre5">Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body</b>. (The word <i class="calibre3">Savior</i> here can have the meaning of Preserver, as it has in 1 Tim. 4:10 JND). So <b class="calibre5">the husband is head of the wife</b>, and he is her preserver as well. As <b class="calibre5">head</b> he loves, leads, and guides; as preserver he provides, protects, and cares for her.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We all know there is great revulsion against this teaching in our day. People accuse Paul of being a bigoted bachelor, a male chauvinist, a woman-hater. Or they say his views reflect the social customs of his day but are no longer applicable today. Such statements are, of course, a frontal attack on the inspiration of the Scriptures. These are not merely Paul’s words; they are the words of God. To refuse them is to refuse Him and invite difficulty and disaster.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:24</span> Nothing could more exalt the role of the wife than comparing it to the role of <b class="calibre5">the church</b> as the Bride of <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. The church’s submission is the pattern to be followed by the wife. She is to be <b class="calibre5">subject in everything</b>—that is, <b class="calibre5">everything</b> that is in accordance with the will of God. No wife would be expected to obey her husband if he required her to compromise her loyalty to the Lord Jesus. But in all the normal relationships of life, she is to obey her husband, even if he is an unbeliever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:25</span> If the foregoing instructions to <b class="calibre5">wives</b> stood alone, if there were no correspondingly high instructions to <b class="calibre5">husbands</b>, then the presentation would be one-sided, if not unfair. But notice the beautiful balance of truth in the Scriptures, and the corresponding standard they require of the <b class="calibre5">husbands</b>. <b class="calibre5">Husbands</b> are not told to keep their wives in subjection; they are told to <b class="calibre5">love</b> their <b class="calibre5">wives just as Christ also loved the church</b>. It has been well said that no wife would mind being submissive to a husband who loves her as much as <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> loves <b class="calibre5">the church</b>. Someone wrote of a man who feared he was displeasing God by loving his wife too much. A Christian worker asked him if he loved her more than Christ loved the church. He said no. “Only when you go beyond that,” said the worker, “are you loving your wife too much.” Christ’s love for <b class="calibre5">the church</b> is presented here in three majestic movements extending from the past to the present to the future. In the past, He demonstrated His love for <b class="calibre5">the church</b> by giving <b class="calibre5">Himself for her</b>. This refers to His sacrificial death on the cross. There He paid the greatest price in order to purchase a Bride for Himself. Just as Eve was brought forth from the side of Adam, so, in a sense, <b class="calibre5">the church</b> was created from the wounded side of the Savior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:26</span> At the present time His love for the church is shown in His work of sanctification: <b class="calibre5">that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word</b>. To <b class="calibre5">sanctify</b> means to set apart. Positionally the church is already sanctified; practically she is being set apart day by day. She is going through a process of moral and spiritual preparation, similar to the one-year course of beauty culture which Esther took before being presented to King Ahasuerus (Est. 2:12–16). The process of sanctification is carried on by <b class="calibre5">the washing of water by the word</b>. In simple terms this means that the lives of believers are cleansed as they hear the words of Christ and obey them. Thus Jesus said to the disciples, “You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you” (John 15:3). And He linked sanctification with the word in His high priestly prayer: “Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth” (John 17:17). Just as the blood of Christ cleanses once for all from the guilt and penalty of sin, so the word of God cleanses continually from the defilement and pollution of sin. This passage teaches that the church is being bathed at the present time, not with literal water, but with the cleansing agent of the word of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:27</span> In the past, Christ’s love was manifested in our <i class="calibre3">redemption</i>. In the present, it is seen in our <i class="calibre3">sanctification</i>. In the future, it will be displayed in our <i class="calibre3">glorification</i>. He Himself will <b class="calibre5">present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but … holy and without blemish</b>. She will then reach the acme of beauty and spiritual perfection.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A. T. Pierson rightly can exclaim:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Think of it—when the omniscient eye looks upon us at the last, He will not find anything that to His immaculate holiness can be so much as a pimple or a mole on a human face. How incredible!<a id="calibre_link-107" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-23">38</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">F. W. Grant concurs:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">No sign of old age about it, no defect; nothing will suit Him then but the bloom and eternity of an eternal youth, the freshness of affections which will never tire, which can know no decay. The Church will be holy and blameless then. After all that we have known of her history, it would be strange to read that, if we did not know how gloriously God maintains His triumph over sin and evil.<a id="calibre_link-108" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-24">39</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:28</span> After soaring off on this magnificent rhapsody dealing with Christ’s love for the church, Paul now returns to remind husbands that this is the pattern they are to imitate: <b class="calibre5">So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies</b>. In imitation of Christ’s love, they should <b class="calibre5">love their own wives</b> as being indeed <b class="calibre5">their own bodies</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the Greek, the word “own” occurs six times in verses 22–33. This emphatic use of the word “own” reminds us that monogamy is God’s will for His people. Although He permitted polygamy in the OT, He never approved it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is also interesting to notice the varied ways in which Paul describes the close relationship of the husband and the wife. He says that in loving his wife, a man is loving his own body (v. 28a); <b class="calibre5">himself</b> (vv. 28b, 33); and “his own flesh” (v. 29). Since marriage involves a true union of persons, and two become one flesh, a man <b class="calibre5">who loves his wife</b> is, in a very real sense, loving <b class="calibre5">himself.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:29</span> Man is born with the instinct to care for his own body. He feeds, clothes, and bathes it; he protects it from discomforts, pain, and harm. Its continued survival depends on this care. This solicitous interest is a pale shadow of the care <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b> has for <b class="calibre5">the church.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:30</span> <b class="calibre5">For we are members of His body</b>. The grace of God is amazing! It not only saves us from sin and hell, but incorporates us into Christ as <b class="calibre5">members of His</b> mystical <b class="calibre5">Body</b>. What volumes this speaks concerning His love for us: He cherishes us as His own Body. What care: He nourishes, sanctifies, and trains us. What security: He will not be in heaven without His <b class="calibre5">members</b>. We are united to Him in a common life. Whatever affects the members affects the Head also.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:31</span> The apostle now quotes Genesis 2:24 as presenting God’s original concept in instituting the marriage relationship. First, the man’s relationship to his parents is superseded by a higher loyalty, that is, his loyalty to his wife. In order to realize the high ideal of the marital relationship, he leaves his parents <b class="calibre5">and</b> is <b class="calibre5">joined to his wife</b>. The second feature is that husband and wife <b class="calibre5">become one flesh</b>: there is a real union of two persons. If these two basic facts were kept in mind, they would eliminate in-law troubles on the one hand, and marital strife on the other.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:32</span> <b class="calibre5">This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</b> Paul now climaxes his discussion of the marriage relationship by announcing this wonderful truth, hitherto unknown, namely, that as a wife is to her husband, so <b class="calibre5">the church</b> is to <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When Paul says the <b class="calibre5">mystery</b> is <b class="calibre5">great</b>, he does not mean it is very mysterious. Rather he means that the implications of the truth are tremendous. The <b class="calibre5">mystery</b> is the wonderful purpose which was hidden in God in previous ages, but which has now been revealed. That purpose is to call out of the nations a people to become the Body and Bride of His glorious Son. The marriage relationship thus finds its perfect antitype in the relation between <b class="calibre5">Christ and the church.</b></p>
      <div class="senseline">

      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:33</span> This final verse is a sentence summary of what the apostle has been saying to husbands and wives. To the husbands the concluding admonition is this: <b class="calibre5">let each one of you</b>, without exception, <b class="calibre5">love his wife as</b> being <b class="calibre5">himself</b>. Not merely as you might love yourself, but in recognition of the fact that she is one with you. To the wives the word is: <b class="calibre5">see that</b> you continually <b class="calibre5">respect</b> and obey your <b class="calibre5">husband</b>. Now stop and think for a moment! What would happen if these divine instructions were widely followed by Christian people today? The answer is obvious. There would be no strife, no separation, no divorce. Our homes would be more like foretastes of heaven than they often are.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:1</span> In chapter 5 we learned that one of the results of being filled with the Spirit is being submissive to one another. We saw that a Spirit-filled wife, for instance, is submissive to her husband. Now we learn that Spirit-filled <b class="calibre5">children</b> willingly submit to the authority of their parents. The fundamental duty of all children is to <b class="calibre5">obey</b> their <b class="calibre5">parents in the Lord</b>. Whether the children are Christians or whether the parents are Christians does not make any difference. The parent-child relationship was ordained for all mankind, not just for believers. The command to <b class="calibre5">obey … in the Lord</b> means, first, that children should <b class="calibre5">obey</b> with the attitude that in doing so they are obeying <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b>: their obedience should be as if to Him. Second, it means they should <b class="calibre5">obey</b> in all matters which are in accordance with the will of God. If their parents ordered them to sin, they should not be expected to comply. In such a case they should courteously refuse and suffer the consequences meekly and without retaliation. However, in all other cases they must be obedient.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Four reasons are given why they should obey. First, it <b class="calibre5">is right</b>. It is a basic principle built into the very structure of family life that those who are immature, impulsive, and inexperienced should submit to the authority of parents, who are older and wiser.</p>

<div class="calibre1" id="calibre_link-59">
    <section type="chapter">
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:2</span> The second reason is that it is scriptural. Here Paul quotes Exodus 20:12: <b class="calibre5">Honor your father and mother</b> (see also Deut. 5:16). This command to <b class="calibre5">honor</b> parents is the <b class="calibre5">first</b> of the Ten Commandments with a specific <b class="calibre5">promise</b> of blessing attached to it. It calls for children to respect, love, and obey their parents.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:3</span> The third reason is that it is for the best interests of the children: <b class="calibre5">that it may be well with you</b>. Think of what would happen to a child who received no instruction and no correction from his parents! He would be personally miserable and socially intolerable.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The fourth reason is that obedience promotes a full life: <b class="calibre5">and you may live long on the earth</b>. In the OT, a Jewish child who obeyed his parents did enjoy a long life. In this Gospel Age, it is not a rule without exceptions. Filial obedience is not always connected with longevity. A dutiful son may die at an early age. But it is true in a general way that the life of discipline and obedience is conducive to health and longevity, whereas a life of rebellion and recklessness often ends prematurely.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:4</span> The instructions to children are now balanced with advice <b class="calibre5">to fathers</b>. They should <b class="calibre5">not provoke</b> their <b class="calibre5">children</b> to anger with unreasonable demands, with undue harshness, with constant nagging. Rather children should be nurtured <b class="calibre5">in the training and admonition of the Lord</b>. <b class="calibre5">Training</b> means discipline and correction, and may be verbal or corporal. <b class="calibre5">Admonition</b> means warning, rebuke, reproof. Child-training should be “in the <b class="calibre5">Lord</b>,” that is, carried out in accordance with His will as revealed in the Bible by one who acts as His representative.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Susannah Wesley, the mother of seventeen children, including John and Charles, once wrote:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The parent who studies to subdue self-will in his child, works together with God in the renewing and saving of a soul. The parent who indulges it, does the Devil’s work, makes religion impractical, salvation unattainable, and does all that in him lies to damn his child, soul and body forever.<a id="calibre_link-109" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-60">40</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:5</span> The third and final sphere of submission in the Christian household is that of servants to <b class="calibre5">masters</b>. The word Paul uses is <b class="calibre5">bondservants</b> or slaves, but the principles apply to servants or employees of all types.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The first duty of employees is to <b class="calibre5">those who are</b> their <b class="calibre5">masters according to the flesh</b>. The expression, <b class="calibre5">masters according to the flesh</b>, reminds us that the employer has jurisdiction as far as physical or mental work is concerned, but he cannot dictate in spiritual matters or command the conscience.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Second, servants should be respectful. <b class="calibre5">Fear and trembling</b> do not mean cowering servility and abject terror; they mean a dutiful respect and a <b class="calibre5">fear</b> of offending the Lord and the employer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Third, service should be conscientious, or <b class="calibre5">in sincerity of heart</b>. We should endeavor to deliver sixty minutes of work for every hour of pay.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Next, our work should be <b class="calibre5">as to Christ</b>. These words show that there should be no real distinction between the secular and the sacred. All that we do should be for Him—with a view to pleasing and honoring Him and to attracting others to Him. The most menial and commonplace tasks in life are ennobled and dignified when they are done for the glory of God. Even washing dishes! That is why some Christian housewives have this motto over their kitchen sink: “Divine service held here three times daily.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:6</span> We should always be diligent, not only when the boss is looking, but conscious that our Master is always looking. It is a natural tendency to slack off when the employer is away, but it is a form of dishonesty. The Christian’s standards of performance should not vary according to the geographical location of the foreman. A customer once urged a Christian sales clerk to give him more than he was paying for, assuring him that his employer was not looking. The sales clerk replied, “My Master is always looking!” As servants of Christ, we should be <b class="calibre5">doing the will of God from the heart</b>, that is, with a sincere desire to please Him. Erdman says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Labor is immeasurably dignified by such considerations as these. The task of the humblest slave may be ennobled by being rendered in such a way as to please Christ, with such good will, with such hearty readiness and zeal, as to merit the approval of the Lord.<a id="calibre_link-110" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-61">41</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:7</span> Then, too, we should serve <b class="calibre5">with good will</b>. Not with an outward display of compliance while we are inwardly seething with resentment, but cheerfully and willingly. Even if a master is overbearing, abusive, and unreasonable, our work can still be done <b class="calibre5">as to the Lord and not to men</b>. It is this type of supernatural behavior that speaks the loudest in the kind of world in which we live.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:8</span> A great incentive to do all as if to Christ is the assurance that He will reward every such good work. <b class="calibre5">Whether</b> a person <b class="calibre5">is a slave or free</b> makes no difference. The Lord notes all the jobs, pleasant or disagreeable, that are done for Him, and He will reward each worker.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Before leaving this section on slaves, some comments should be made:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The NT does not condemn slavery as such. In fact, it likens the true believer to a slave (bondservant) of Christ (v. 6). But the abuses of slavery have disappeared wherever the gospel has gone—mainly by moral reformation.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The NT has more to say to slaves than it has to kings. This may be a reflection of the fact that not many wise, mighty, or noble are called (1 Cor. 1:26). Probably most Christians are found in the lower economic and social brackets. The emphasis on slaves also shows that the most menial servants are not excluded from the choicest blessings of Christianity.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. The effectiveness of these instructions to slaves is seen in the fact that in the early days of Christianity, Christian slaves frequently brought higher prices at the auction than heathen bondservants. It should be true today that Christian employees are worth more to their employers than those who have never been touched by the grace of God.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:9</span> <b class="calibre5">Masters</b> should be guided by the <b class="calibre5">same</b> general principles as servants. They should be fair, kind, and honest. They should be particularly careful to refrain from abusive and <b class="calibre5">threatening</b> language. If they exercise discipline in this area, they will never have to resort to physical abuse of their servants. And they should always remember that they have a <b class="calibre5">Master also</b>, the same <b class="calibre5">Master</b> who <b class="calibre5">is in heaven</b> that the slave has. Earthly distinctions are leveled in the presence of the Lord. Both master and servant will one day give an account to Him.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-132" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-62">E. Exhortations Concerning the Christian Warfare (6:10–20)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">6:10</span> Paul is coming to the close of his Epistle. Addressing all the family of God, he makes a stirring appeal to them as soldiers of Christ. Every true child of God soon learns that the Christian life is a warfare. The hosts of Satan are committed to hinder and obstruct the work of Christ and to knock the individual soldier out of combat. The more effective a believer is for the Lord, the more he will experience the savage attacks of the enemy: the devil does not waste his ammunition on nominal Christians. In our own strength we are no match for the devil. So the first preparatory command is that we should be continually strengthened <b class="calibre5">in the Lord and in the</b> boundless resources <b class="calibre5">of His might</b>. God’s best soldiers are those who are conscious of their own weakness and ineffectiveness, and who rely solely on Him. “God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty” (1 Cor. 1:27b). Our weakness commends itself to <b class="calibre5">the power of His might</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:11</span> The second command is concerned with the need for divine <b class="calibre5">armor</b>. The believer must <b class="calibre5">put on the whole armor of God that</b> he <b class="calibre5">may be able to stand against the</b> stratagems <b class="calibre5">of the devil</b>. It is necessary to be completely armed; one or two pieces will not do. Nothing less than the whole panoply which God provides will keep us invulnerable. <b class="calibre5">The devil</b> has various stratagems—discouragement, frustration, confusion, moral failure, and doctrinal error. He knows our weakest point and aims for it. If he cannot disable us by one method, he will try for another.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:12</span> This warfare is not a matter of contending against godless philosophers, crafty priests, Christ-denying cultists, or infidel rulers. The battle is against demonic forces, against battalions of fallen angels, against evil spirits who wield tremendous power. Though we cannot see them, we are constantly surrounded by wicked spirit-beings. While it is true that they cannot indwell a true believer, they can oppress and harass him. The Christian should not be morbidly occupied with the subject of demonism; neither should he live in fear of demons. In the armor of God, he has all he needs to hold his ground against their onslaughts. The apostle speaks of these fallen angels as <b class="calibre5">principalities</b> and <b class="calibre5">powers</b>, as <b class="calibre5">rulers of the darkness of this age</b>, and as <b class="calibre5">spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places</b>. We do not have sufficient knowledge to distinguish between these; perhaps they refer to spirit-rulers with differing degrees of authority, such as presidents, governors, mayors, and aldermen, on the human scale.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:13</span> As Paul wrote, he was probably guarded by a Roman soldier in full armor. Always quick to see spiritual lessons in the natural realm, he makes the application: we are flanked by formidable foes; we must <b class="calibre5">take up the whole armor of God, that</b> we <b class="calibre5">may be able to withstand</b> when the conflict reaches its fiercest intensity, and still be found standing when the smoke of battle has cleared away. <b class="calibre5">The evil day</b> probably refers to any time when the enemy comes against us like a flood. Satanic opposition seems to occur in waves, advancing and receding. Even after our Lord’s temptation in the wilderness, the devil left Him for a season (Luke 4:13).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:14</span> The first piece of armor mentioned is the belt of <b class="calibre5">truth</b>. Certainly we must be faithful in holding the <b class="calibre5">truth</b> of God’s word, but it is also necessary for the <b class="calibre5">truth</b> to hold us. We must apply it to our daily lives. As we test everything by the <b class="calibre5">truth</b>, we find strength and protection in the combat.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The second piece is <b class="calibre5">the breastplate of righteousness</b>. Every believer is clothed with the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21), but he must also manifest integrity and uprightness in his personal life. Someone has said, “When a man is clothed in practical righteousness, he is impregnable. Words are no defense against accusation, but a good life is.” If our conscience is void of offense toward God and man, the devil has nothing to shoot at. David put on <b class="calibre5">the breastplate of righteousness</b> in Psalm 7:3–5. The Lord Jesus wore it at all times (Isa. 59:17).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:15</span> The soldier must have his <b class="calibre5">feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace</b>. This suggests a readiness to go out with the good news <b class="calibre5">of peace</b>, and therefore an invasion into enemy territory. When we relax in our tents, we are in deadly peril. Our safety is to be found in following the beautiful feet of the Savior on the mountains, bearing glad tidings and publishing peace (Isa. 52:7; Rom. 10:15).</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Take my feet and let them be</p>
        <p class="sl">Swift and beautiful for Thee</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Frances Ridley Havergal</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:16</span> In addition, the soldier must take <b class="calibre5">the shield of faith</b> so that when <b class="calibre5">the fiery darts of the wicked one</b> come zooming at him, they will hit the shield and fall harmlessly to the ground. <b class="calibre5">Faith</b> here is firm confidence in the Lord and in His word. When temptations burn, when circumstances are adverse, when doubts assail, when shipwreck threatens, <b class="calibre5">faith</b> looks up and says, “I believe God.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:17</span> <b class="calibre5">The helmet</b> God provides is <b class="calibre5">salvation</b> (Isa. 59:17). No matter how hot the battle, the Christian is not daunted, since he knows that ultimate victory is sure. Assurance of eventual deliverance preserves him from retreat or surrender. “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Rom. 8:31).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, the soldier takes <b class="calibre5">the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God</b>. The classic illustration of this is our Lord’s use of this <b class="calibre5">sword</b> in His encounter with Satan. Three times He quoted the word of God—not just random verses but the appropriate verses which the Holy Spirit gave Him for that occasion (Luke 4:1–13). <b class="calibre5">The word</b><a id="calibre_link-111" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-63">42</a> <b class="calibre5">of God</b> here does not mean the whole Bible, but the particular portion of the Bible which best suits the occasion.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">David Watson says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">God gives us all the protection that we need. We must see that there is a “ring of truth” about our walk with the Lord, that our lives are right (“righteous”) with God and with one another, that we seek to make peace wherever we go, that we lift up that shield of faith together to quench the flaming darts of the evil one, that we protect our minds from fears and anxieties that easily assail, and that we use God’s word to good effect in the power of the Spirit. Remember it was by the repeated sword thrusts of God’s word that Jesus overcame his adversary in the wilderness.<a id="calibre_link-112" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-64">43</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:18</span> <b class="calibre5">Prayer</b> is not mentioned as a part of the armor; but we would not be overrating its importance if we say that it is the atmosphere in which the soldier must live and breathe. It is the spirit in which he must don the armor and face the foe. <b class="calibre5">Prayer</b> should be continual, not sporadic; a habit, not an isolated act. Then too the soldier should use all kinds of <b class="calibre5">prayer</b>: public and private; deliberate and spontaneous; supplication and intercession; confession and humiliation; praise and thanksgiving.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And <b class="calibre5">prayer</b> should be <b class="calibre5">in the Spirit</b>, that is, inspired and led by Him. Formal prayers recited merely by rote (without giving thought to their meaning)—of what value are they in combat against the hosts of hell? There must be vigilance in <b class="calibre5">prayer</b>: <b class="calibre5">watchful to this end</b>. We must watch against drowsiness, mind-wandering, and preoccupation with other things. <b class="calibre5">Prayer</b> requires spiritual keenness, alertness, and concentration. And there must be <b class="calibre5">perseverance</b> in prayer. We must keep on asking, seeking, knocking (Luke 11:9). <b class="calibre5">Supplication</b> should be made <b class="calibre5">for all the saints</b>. They are engaged in the conflict too, and need to be supported in <b class="calibre5">prayer</b> by their fellow soldiers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:19</span> Regarding Paul’s personal request, <b class="calibre5">and for me</b>, Blaikie remarks:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Mark the <i class="calibre3">unpriestly</i> idea! So far from Paul having a store of grace for all the Ephesians, he needed their prayers that, out of the one living store, the needful grace might be given to him.<a id="calibre_link-113" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-65">44</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul was writing from prison. Yet he did not ask prayer for his early release. Rather he asked for <b class="calibre5">utterance</b> in opening his <b class="calibre5">mouth boldly</b> to declare <b class="calibre5">the mystery of the gospel</b>. This is Paul’s final mention of <b class="calibre5">the mystery</b> in Ephesians. Here it is presented as the reason for his bonds. Yet he has no regrets. Quite the contrary! He wants to broadcast it more and more.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:20</span> Ambassadors are generally granted diplomatic immunity from arrest and imprisonment. But men will tolerate almost anything better than they will tolerate the gospel. No other subject stirs such emotion, arouses such hostility and suspicion, and provokes such persecution. So Christ’s representative was <b class="calibre5">an ambassador in chains</b>. Eadie states it well:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">A legate from the mightiest Sovereignty, charged with an embassy of unparalleled nobleness and urgency, and bearing with him credentials of unmistakable authenticity, is detained in captivity.<a id="calibre_link-114" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-66">45</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The particular part of Paul’s message that stirred the hostility of narrow religionists was the announcement that believing Jews and believing Gentiles are now formed into one new society, sharing equal privileges, and acknowledging Christ as Head.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-133" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-67">F. Paul’s Personal Greetings (6:21–24)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">6:21, 22</span> Paul was sending <b class="calibre5">Tychicus</b> from Rome to Ephesus to let the saints know how he was getting along. He commends <b class="calibre5">Tychicus</b> as <b class="calibre5">a beloved brother and faithful minister</b> (servant) <b class="calibre5">in the Lord</b>. There are only five references to this man in the NT. He was one of the party who traveled with Paul from Greece to Asia (Acts 20:4). He was the apostle’s messenger to the Christians at Colosse (Col. 4:7); to Ephesus (cf. 6:21 with 2 Tim. 4:12) and possibly to Titus in Crete (Titus 3:12). His twofold mission at this time was to inform the saints concerning Paul’s welfare in prison, and also to encourage their <b class="calibre5">hearts</b>, allaying any unnecessary fears.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:23</span> In the closing verses, we have Paul’s characteristic greetings—<i class="calibre3">peace</i> and <i class="calibre3">grace</i>. In combining these two, he wishes for his readers the sum of all blessings. Also in combining the characteristic Jewish and Gentile words, he may be making a final veiled reference to the mystery of the gospel—Jew and Gentile now made one in Christ. In verse 23 he desires that his readers may have <b class="calibre5">peace</b> and <b class="calibre5">love with faith</b>. <b class="calibre5">Peace</b> would garrison their hearts in every circumstance of life. <b class="calibre5">Love</b> would enable them to worship God and work with one another. <b class="calibre5">Faith</b> would empower them for exploits in the Christian warfare. All these blessings come <b class="calibre5">from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</b>, a fact that would be impossible if They were not equal.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:24</span> Finally the beloved apostle wishes <b class="calibre5">grace</b> for <b class="calibre5">all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ</b> with an incorruptible, sincere love. True Christian love has the quality of permanence: its flame may flicker and grow low at times, but it is never extinguished.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Roman prison has long since given up its noble inmate. The great apostle has entered into his reward and seen the face of his Beloved. But the Letter is still with us—as fresh and alive as the day it came from his heart and pen. In the twentieth century it still speaks to us words of instruction, inspiration, conviction, and exhortation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In concluding our commentary on Ephesians we find ourselves in hearty agreement with the words of H. W. Webb-Peploe:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">There is perhaps no writing in the Book of God so majestic and so wonderful: and therefore, how impossible it is for any man, as a messenger even from God Himself, to do justice to it in the space allotted to us! I hope we may draw nigh to it, simply seeking for teachings upon holiness, teachings by which we may be sent forth to live a nobler and higher life than hitherto, and by which we may be enabled to glorify God.<a id="calibre_link-115" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-68">46</a></p>

A good example of this construction is “our God and Savior Jesus Christ” in 2 Peter 1:1, where the liberal RSV translators felt constrained by grammar to be stronger for the deity of Christ than even the King James. (The grammatical rule was not clearly defined till the late 1700s.) In the plural, as here, the rule does not always apply, though the construction at least closely associates the two nouns (cf. “Scribes and Pharisees,” etc.).</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-86" class="ahaft">I. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
      <p class="pf">A denomination’s “First Church” in any town or city has special prestige in the eyes of its adherents. Imagine, then, the importance of the first known church—before there were any denominations—not merely in a single town, but in all of Europe! Such was the congregation at Philippi, in ancient Macedonia (northern Greece). How Christians in the West should rejoice (and even non-Christians, if they knew of the blessed by-products of Christianity they enjoy) that Paul heeded “the Macedonian call” and turned west, not east, in his evangelization of the Roman Empire! Perhaps the continent of Asia would today be sending Christian missionaries to Europe and North America instead of vice versa, had not the gospel taken hold in Europe.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Philippian assembly was generous, sending support to Paul time and again. And that, humanly speaking, is the reason for this “thank you letter.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But Philippians is much, much more. It is truly the Epistle of joy—forms of “joy” and “rejoice” occurring over twelve times in its four chapters. Paul knew how to rejoice in good times or hard times (4:11). Also, there is little controversy or negative admonition in this “upbeat” Letter.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The key reason Christians <i class="calibre3">can</i> rejoice is that the Son of God was willing to come to earth as a Man—and a Bondservant at that! Not stopping at healing and teaching, He went all the way to death—even death on a cross. Philippians 2:5–11 expresses this great truth in a beautiful paragraph that many believe is an early Christian hymn, either quoted by Paul or original with him. Even this passage is included to teach unity through humility. Doctrine is never divorced from duty in the NT, as it often is among modern church people—with sad results.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This, then, is Philippians, one of the most cheerful and attractive books in the whole word of God.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-88" class="ah">II. Authorship</h2>
      <p class="paft">Since most scholars regard the Pauline authorship of Philippians as indisputable, we cite the evidence largely for completeness. Some scholars think they see traces of <i class="calibre3">two</i> letters combined in Philippians, or at least that the Bondservant passage (2:5–11) is interpolated. No manuscript evidence exists for these theories.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3">external evidence</i> is strong. Those who quote the Letter early—often specifically mentioning it as by Paul—include Ignatius, Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian. Both Marcion’s “canon” and the Muratorian Canon ascribe the book to Paul.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Besides the obvious reference to Paul in 1:1, the entire style and wording ring with Pauline tones. The arguments against Pauline authorship tend to be petty, such as maintaining that the reference to “bishops and deacons” in 1:1 demands a date later than Paul’s lifetime. This would be true if we read back <i class="calibre3">later</i> ideas of bishops into the first century. But Paul uses <i class="calibre3">bishops</i> (<i class="calibre3">episkopoi</i>, the Greek work for overseers or superintendents) both in the Pastoral Epistles and Acts 20:28 as synonymous with <i class="calibre3">elders</i>. Also, it should be noted that the single congregation addressed had a <i class="calibre3">plurality</i> of bishops.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">H. A. A. Kennedy beautifully sums up the <i class="calibre3">internal evidence</i>:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">Perhaps no Pauline epistle bears more conclusively the stamp of authenticity. There is an artlessness, a delicacy of feeling, a frank outpouring of the heart which could not be simulated.<a id="calibre_link-42" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-2">1</a></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-90" class="ah">III. Date</h2>
      <p class="paft">Like Ephesians, Colossians, and Philemon, Philippians was written from prison, hence the category “Prison (or Captivity) Epistles.” But while the other three were almost assuredly written and sent at nearly the same time (about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 60), Philippians is clearly written a little later. Marcion specifically says that Paul wrote Philippians from Rome, and this fits well with 1:13 and 4:22, which verses suggest Rome as the place of origin. Paul spent two years under arrest in Rome; hints found in the Letter suggest that Philippians was written near the end of that time. For example, 1:12–18 would imply a certain length of time for preaching in the Eternal City since Paul arrived. That Paul’s case was about to be decided (and probably in a positive way—by release) seems indicated in 1:12, 13, 19, 23–26.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">These facts, plus allowing time for letters, visits, and gifts of money that are alluded to in the Epistle, give us a date of late <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 61.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-92" class="ah">IV. Background and Theme</h2>
      <p class="paft">It was a momentous day in the history of Christian missions when the Apostle Paul came as far as Troas on his Second Missionary Journey. Troas was located on the northwest coast of Asia Minor, across the Aegean Sea from Greece. One night, in a vision, a man of Macedonia appeared to the apostle, saying, “Come over to Macedonia, and help us” (Acts 16:9). Immediately Paul arranged to sail for Macedonia with Timothy, and also with Luke and Silas. They first set foot on <i class="calibre3">European</i> soil at Neapolis, then journeyed inland to Philippi. The latter city was at that time a Roman colony, governed by Roman officials, and granting the rights and privileges of Roman citizenship to its inhabitants.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">On the Sabbath, the gospel preachers went down by the riverside where a group of women were in the habit of gathering for prayer (Acts 16:13). One of these was Lydia, a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira. When she accepted the gospel message, she became the first known convert to Christianity on the continent of Europe.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But Paul’s stay in Philippi did not prove entirely peaceful. A young woman possessed with a spirit of divination (foretelling future events) met the servants of the Lord and for some time followed them, crying out, “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation” (Acts 16:17). Not willing to accept the testimony of one possessed by an evil spirit, the apostle commanded the demon to come out of her. When her masters, who had profited from this girl’s predictions, saw what had happened, they were furious with Paul. They dragged him and Silas into the market place to face the representatives of Rome. These magistrates, in turn, commanded that they should be beaten and thrown into prison.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What happened in that Philippian jail is now well-known. At midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, opening all the doors of the prison and causing the prisoners’ chains to be loosed. The jailer, thinking that the prisoners had escaped, was about to kill himself when Paul reassured him that his inmates had not fled. Then the jailer cried out, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” The memorable answer came back, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved” (Acts 16:31). God’s grace had won another trophy at Philippi. In the morning, the local authorities urged Paul and his companions to leave town as quickly as possible. This Paul refused to do. He reminded them that they had beaten him, a Roman citizen, and had imprisoned him without a fair trial. After continued appeals from the magistrates to leave the city, Paul and his companions first went to visit in the home of Lydia and then took their leave (Acts 16:40).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">About ten years later, Paul wrote to the Philippians. He was in prison again. The Philippians had heard that Paul was in prison, so they sent a gift of money to him. Epaphroditus had been commissioned to carry this gift to Paul. After delivering it, he decided to stay there a while and help the apostle in his troubles. Epaphroditus himself became ill in carrying out these duties; in fact, he nearly died. But God had mercy on him and raised him back to health once again. He is now ready to go back to Philippi, to his home assembly, and so the apostle is sending back this Letter of acknowledgment with him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Philippians is one of the most personal and affectionate of Paul’s Epistles. It reveals clearly that this congregation held a very special place of esteem in his affection. As we read it, we detect the very tender bond that existed between the great apostle and this church which he had founded.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-24" class="ahaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-72">I. PAUL’S GREETING, PRAISE, AND PRAYER (1:1–11)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:1</span> Paul and Timothy are linked together at the opening of this Epistle. This does not mean that Timothy helped to write the Letter. He had been with Paul when he first visited Philippi, so he was known to the saints there. Now <b class="calibre5">Timothy</b> is with <b class="calibre5">Paul</b> as the apostle opens this Letter.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul was now an older man (Phmn. 9), while Timothy was still quite young. Thus youth and age were yoked together in the service of the Best of masters. Jowett puts it nicely: “It is the union of springtime and autumn; of enthusiasm and experience; of impulse and wisdom; of tender hope and quiet and rich assurance.”<a id="calibre_link-43" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-73">2</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Both are described as <b class="calibre5">bondservants of Jesus Christ</b>. Both loved their Master. The ties of Calvary bound them to the service of their Savior forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Letter is addressed <b class="calibre5">to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the bishops and deacons</b>. The word <i class="calibre3">all</i> recurs in this Epistle quite frequently. Paul’s affectionate interest went out to <b class="calibre5">all</b> the Lord’s people.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi</b> describes the dual position of the believers. As to their spiritual status, they were set apart by God <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>. As to their geographical location, they were at <b class="calibre5">Philippi</b>. Two places at the same time!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then the apostle mentions <b class="calibre5">the bishops and deacons. The bishops</b> were the elders or overseers in the assembly—those who took a pastoral interest in the flock of God and who led the flock by their godly example. The <b class="calibre5">deacons</b>, on the other hand, were the servants of the church who were probably chiefly concerned with its material affairs, such as finances, etc.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There were only these three groups in the church—<b class="calibre5">saints, bishops, and deacons</b>. If there had been a clergyman in charge, Paul would have mentioned him also. Instead he speaks only of <b class="calibre5">bishops</b> (plural) and <b class="calibre5">deacons</b> (also plural).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Here we have a remarkable picture of the simplicity of church life in the early days. <b class="calibre5">The saints</b> are mentioned first, then their <i class="calibre3">spiritual guides</i>, and last their <i class="calibre3">temporal servants</i>. That is all!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:2</span> In Paul’s characteristic greeting, he wishes the saints <b class="calibre5">grace … and peace</b>. The former is not so much the grace which comes to a sinner at the time of his conversion as the <b class="calibre5">grace</b> which he must constantly obtain at the throne of grace to help in every time of need (Heb. 4:16). Likewise, the <b class="calibre5">peace</b> which Paul craves for them is not so much peace with God, which is theirs already, as the <b class="calibre5">peace</b> of God which comes through prayer and thanksgiving (4:6, 7).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Both blessings come <b class="calibre5">from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ</b>. The apostle honors the Son even as he honors the Father (John 5:23). There is no mistaking that to Paul, Jesus Christ is God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:3</span> Now Paul bursts into a song of thanksgiving. But that is nothing new for the apostle. The walls of the Philippian jail had echoed the songs of Paul and Silas on their first visit there. As he writes these words, he is probably a prisoner in Rome—but he is still singing “songs in the night.” The indomitable Paul! <b class="calibre5">Every remembrance</b> of the Philippians awakened thanksgiving in his heart. Not only were they his children in the faith, but in many ways they had proved to be a model church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:4</span> In every prayer, he made supplication for the Philippians <b class="calibre5">with joy</b>. To him it was a sheer delight to pray for them—not dull drudgery. From this and many similar passages in Paul’s writing, we learn that he was a man of prayer. It is not necessary to search further for the reason he was so wonderfully used of God. When we remember the extent of his travels and the host of Christians he knew, we marvel that he maintained such a personal, intimate interest in them all.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:5</span> The specific reason for his thanksgiving was their <b class="calibre5">fellowship</b> in furthering <b class="calibre5">the gospel from the first day until now. Fellowship</b> might include financial assistance, but it extends also to prayer support and a wholehearted devotion to the spread of the good news. When Paul mentions <b class="calibre5">the first day</b>, one cannot help wondering if the jailor was still alive when this Letter was publicly read to the assembly at Philippi. If so, this mention of Paul’s introduction to the Philippian believers would certainly have struck a responsive chord in his heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:6</span> As the apostle thinks of the good start the believers have made in the Christian life, he is <b class="calibre5">confident</b> that God will finish the <b class="calibre5">good work</b> He <b class="calibre5">has begun.</b></p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">The work which His goodness began,</p>
        <p class="sl">The arm of His strength will complete;</p>
        <p class="sl">His promise is Yea and Amen,</p>
        <p class="sl">And never was forfeited yet.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Augustus M. Toplady</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft"><b class="calibre5">Good work</b> may refer to their salvation, or it may mean their active financial participation in the furtherance of the gospel. <b class="calibre5">The day of Jesus Christ</b> refers to the time of His coming again to take His people home to heaven and probably also includes the Judgment Seat of Christ, when service for Him will be reviewed and rewarded.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:7</span> Paul feels justified in being thankful for the Philippians. In his <b class="calibre5">heart</b> he treasures a lasting memory of how loyally they stood with him, whether he was on trial, in prison, or traveling about <b class="calibre5">in the defense and confirmation of the gospel</b>. <b class="calibre5">The defense of the gospel</b> refers to the ministry of answering the critics, while the <b class="calibre5">confirmation of the gospel</b> relates rather to establishing the message more firmly in the hearts of those who are already believers. W. E. Vine says: “The gospel both overthrows its foes and strengthens its friends.”<a id="calibre_link-44" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-74">3</a> <b class="calibre5">Grace</b> here means the undeserved strength from God to carry on the work of the Lord in the face of severe opposition.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:8</span> The memory of their faithful cooperation makes the apostle <b class="calibre5">long</b> to be with them again. He calls <b class="calibre5">God</b> to <b class="calibre5">witness how greatly</b> he yearns <b class="calibre5">for</b> them <b class="calibre5">with the affection of Jesus Christ</b>. Paul’s expression of love is all the more remarkable when we remember that he had been born a Jew and was writing to people of Gentile descent. The grace of God had broken down the ancient hatred, and now they were all one in Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:9</span> Thanksgiving now gives way to prayer. Will Paul ask wealth, comfort, or freedom from trouble for them? No, he asks that their <b class="calibre5">love</b> might constantly increase <b class="calibre5">in knowledge and all discernment</b>. The primary aim of the Christian life is to <b class="calibre5">love</b> God and to <b class="calibre5">love</b> one’s fellow man. But love is not just a matter of the emotions. In effective service for the Lord, we must use our intelligence and exercise <b class="calibre5">discernment</b>. Otherwise, our efforts are apt to be futile. So Paul is here praying not only that the Philippians will continue in the display of Christian love, but also that their <b class="calibre5">love</b> will be exercised in full <b class="calibre5">knowledge and all discernment.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:10</span> Love that is thus enlightened will enable them to discern the things that are more <b class="calibre5">excellent</b>. In all realms of life, some things are good and others are better. The good is often the enemy of the best. For effective service, these distinctions must be made.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Love that is enlightened will also enable them to avoid what is questionable or downright wrong. Paul would have them <b class="calibre5">sincere</b>,<a id="calibre_link-45" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-75">4</a> that is, utterly transparent, and blameless in view of <b class="calibre5">the day of Christ</b>. To be <b class="calibre5">without offense</b> does not mean to be sinless. We all commit sins, but the blameless person is the one who confesses and forsakes the sin, asking forgiveness from those who were wronged and making restitution whenever possible.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The day of Christ</b>, as in verse 6, refers to the Rapture and the subsequent judgment of the believer’s works.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:11</span> The final petition of the apostle’s prayer is that the Christians might be <b class="calibre5">filled with the fruits of righteousness</b>, that is, with <b class="calibre5">the fruits</b> which <b class="calibre5">righteousness</b> produces, or with all the Christian virtues that make up a righteous life. The source of these virtues is <b class="calibre5">Jesus Christ</b>, and their object is <b class="calibre5">the glory and praise of God</b>. This petition of Paul is exactly parallel to the words in Isaiah 61:3, “that they may be called trees of righteousness (<b class="calibre5">being filled with the fruits of righteousness</b>), the planting of the Lord (<b class="calibre5">which are by Jesus Christ</b>), that He may be glorified (<b class="calibre5">to the glory and praise of God.</b>)”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">“The word ‘fruit,’ ” Lehman Strauss writes, “ … is associated closely with our relation to Christ and His expectation of us. The branches on a vine are intended to bear fruit.”<a id="calibre_link-46" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-76">5</a></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-25" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-35">II. PAUL’S IMPRISONMENT, PROSPECTS, AND PLEA FOR PERSEVERANCE (1:12–30)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:12</span> The prayer is ended. Paul next rehearses his blessings, that is, the benefits that have resulted from his imprisonment. Jowett calls this section “The Fortune of Misfortune.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle would have the <b class="calibre5">brethren know that the things which happened</b> to him, that is, his trial and imprisonment, have resulted in <b class="calibre5">the furtherance of the gospel</b> rather than its hindrance, as might have been expected. This is another wonderful illustration of how God overrules the wicked plans of demons and men and brings triumph out of seeming tragedy and beauty from ashes. “Man has his wickedness, but God has His way.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:13</span> First of all, Paul’s <b class="calibre5">chains</b> have become <b class="calibre5">evident</b> as being <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>. By this he means that it has become widely known that he was imprisoned as a result of his testimony for Christ and not as a criminal or evildoer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The real reason for his <b class="calibre5">chains</b> became well-known throughout the <b class="calibre5">palace guard</b> and in all other places. <b class="calibre5">Palace guard</b> may mean either: (1) The whole praetorian <b class="calibre5">guard</b>, that is, the Roman soldiers who guarded the <b class="calibre5">palace</b> where the emperor dwelt, or (2) The whole praetorium itself. The praetorium was the <b class="calibre5">palace</b> and here would include all of its occupants. In any event, Paul is saying that his imprisonment has served as a testimony to the representatives of the Roman imperial power where he was.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">T. W. Drury writes:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The very chain which Roman discipline riveted on the prisoner’s arm secured to his side a hearer who would tell the story of patient suffering for Christ, among those who, the next day, might be in attendance on Nero himself.<a id="calibre_link-47" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-36">6</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:14</span> A second favorable outcome of his imprisonment was that other Christians were thereby encouraged to be more fearless in testifying for the Lord Jesus. Persecution often has the effect of transforming quiet and bashful believers into courageous witnesses.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:15</span> The motive in some hearts was jealousy and rivalry. They preached <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> out of <b class="calibre5">envy</b> and contentiousness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Others had sincere and pure motives; they preached Christ <b class="calibre5">from good will</b>, in an honest effort to help the apostle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:16</span> The jealous preachers thought that by doing this they might make Paul’s imprisonment more bitter. Their message was good, but their temper was bad. It is sad to think that Christian service can be carried on in the energy of the flesh, motivated by greed, strife, pride, and envy. This teaches the necessity for watching our motives when we serve the Lord. We must not do it for self-display, for the advancement of a religious sect, or for the defeat of other Christians.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Here is a good example of the necessity for our love to be exercised in knowledge and discernment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:17</span> Others were preaching the gospel <b class="calibre5">out of</b> pure and sincere <b class="calibre5">love, knowing that</b> Paul was determined to defend <b class="calibre5">the gospel</b>. There was nothing selfish, sectarian, or cruel in their service. They knew very well that Paul had been committed to prison because of his bold stand for <b class="calibre5">the gospel</b>. So they determined to carry on the work while he was thus confined.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:18</span> Paul refuses to be downcast by the wrong motives of some. <b class="calibre5">Christ is</b> being <b class="calibre5">preached</b> by both groups, and that is for him a great cause for rejoicing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is remarkable that under such difficult circumstances, Paul does not feel sorry for himself or seek the sympathy of others. Rather he is filled with the joy of the Lord and encourages his readers to rejoice also.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:19</span> The outlook is encouraging. The apostle knows that the whole course of events will lead to his <b class="calibre5">deliverance. Deliverance</b> (KJV “salvation”) here does not mean the salvation of Paul’s soul, but rather his liberation from prison. The means which God will use in effecting his release will be the <b class="calibre5">prayer</b> of the Philippians and the ministry or help of the <b class="calibre5">Spirit of Jesus Christ</b>. Marvel here at the importance which Paul puts on the prayers of a feeble band of believers. He sees them as sufficiently powerful to thwart the purposes and the mighty power of Rome. It is true; Christians can influence the destiny of nations and change the course of history through prayer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</b> means the power of the Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> stretched forth in his behalf—the strength which the Spirit would supply to him. In general, it refers to “the boundless resources which the Spirit supplies to enable believers to stand fast, regardless of what the circumstances may be.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:20</span> As he thought of the prayers of the Christians and the assistance of the Holy Spirit, he expressed his eager desire and <b class="calibre5">hope</b> that he might never <b class="calibre5">be ashamed</b>, but rather that he might always have a fearless and outspoken witness for Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And no matter what the outcome of judicial processes might be—whether he was to be freed or put to <b class="calibre5">death</b>—his ambition was that <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> should <b class="calibre5">be magnified in</b> his <b class="calibre5">body</b>. To magnify does not mean to make Christ greater. He is already great, and nothing we can do will make Him greater. But to magnify means to cause Christ to be esteemed or praised by others. Guy King shows how Christ can <b class="calibre5">be magnified</b> by our bodies in <b class="calibre5">life:</b></p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">… magnified by lips that bear happy testimony to Him; magnified by hands employed in His happy service; magnified by feet only too happy to go on His errands; magnified by knees happily bent in prayer for His kingdom; magnified by shoulders happy to bear one another’s burdens.<a id="calibre_link-48" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-37">7</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Christ can also <b class="calibre5">be magnified</b> in our bodies <b class="calibre5">by death</b>—bodies worn out in His service; bodies pierced by savage spears; bodies torn by stones or burned at the stake.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:21</span> Here, in a nutshell, is Paul’s philosophy of life. He did not live for money, fame, or pleasure. The object of his life was to love, worship, and serve the Lord Jesus. He wanted his life to be like the life of <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. He wanted the Savior to live out His life through him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And to die is gain. To die</b> is to be with Christ and to be like Him forever. It is to serve Him with unsinning heart and with feet that will never stray. We do not ordinarily think of death as one of our gains. Sad to say, the outlook today seems to be that “to live is earthly gain, and to die would be the end of gain.” But, says Jowett: “To the Apostle Paul, death was not a darksome passageway, where all our treasures rot away in a swift corruption; it was a place of gracious transition, ‘a covered way that leadeth into light.’ ”<a id="calibre_link-49" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-38">8</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:22</span> <b class="calibre5">If</b> it is God’s will for Paul to <b class="calibre5">live on</b> a while longer <b class="calibre5">in the flesh</b>, then that will mean fruitful <b class="calibre5">labor</b> for him. He will be able to give further help to the Lord’s people. But it was a difficult decision for him—whether to go to the Savior whom he loved, or to remain on earth in the Lord’s service, to which he was also very attached. He did not know which to <b class="calibre5">choose.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:23</span> To be <b class="calibre5">hard pressed between the two</b> means to be required to make a difficult decision between <b class="calibre5">two</b> possibilities—that of going home to heaven or that of remaining on earth as an apostle of Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He ardently longed <b class="calibre5">to depart and be with Christ, which is far better</b>. If he only considered his own interests, this is doubtless the choice he would make.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that Paul did not believe in any theory of soul-sleep. He believed that the Christian goes to <b class="calibre5">be with Christ</b> at the time of death and that he is in the conscious enjoyment of the presence of the Lord. How ridiculous it would be for him to say, as some do today: “To live is Christ; to sleep is gain.” Or, “To depart and to sleep is far better.” “Sleep” is used in the NT of the believer’s <i class="calibre3">body</i> at the time of death (1 Thess. 4:14), never of his soul. Soul-sleep is a myth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice, too, that death is not to be confused with the coming of the Savior. At the time of death, we go to <b class="calibre5">be with Him</b>. At the time of the Rapture, He comes to us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:24</span> <b class="calibre5">For</b> the sake of the Philippians, it was <b class="calibre5">more needful</b> for Paul to live on earth a while longer. One cannot help but be impressed with the unselfishness of this great-hearted man. He does not think of his own comfort or ease, but rather of what will best advance the cause of Christ and the welfare of His people.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:25</span> <b class="calibre5">Being confident of this</b>—that he was still needed on earth to instruct, comfort, and encourage the saints—Paul knew that he would not be put to death at this time. How did he know? We believe that he lived so close to the Lord that the Holy Spirit was able to communicate this knowledge to him. “The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him.” (Ps. 25:14). Those who dwell deep in God, in quiet meditation, hear secrets that are drowned out by the noise, rush, and bustle of life today. You have to be near to hear. Paul was near.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">By remaining in the flesh, Paul would be able to promote their spiritual <b class="calibre5">progress and</b> increase the <b class="calibre5">joy</b> that was theirs through trusting in the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:26</span> Through his being spared for longer life and service on earth, the Philippians would have added cause for <b class="calibre5">rejoicing</b> in the Lord when he would visit them once again. Can you not imagine how they would throw their arms around him and kiss him, and praise the Lord with great joy when he would arrive at Philippi? Perhaps they would say, “Well, Paul, we prayed for you, but honestly, we never expected to see you here again. But how we praise the Lord that He has given you back to us once more!”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:27</span> Now Paul adds a word of caution: <b class="calibre5">“Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ.”</b> Christians should be Christlike. Citizens of heaven should behave accordingly. We should be in practice what we are in position.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In addition to this plea for consistency, the apostle makes an appeal for constancy. Specifically, he desires <b class="calibre5">that whether</b> he comes to them personally, or, being <b class="calibre5">absent</b>, hears reports about them, he may know that they are standing <b class="calibre5">fast</b> with a common <b class="calibre5">spirit</b>, and unitedly laboring earnestly <b class="calibre5">for the faith of the gospel</b>, that is, the Christian faith. Christians face a common foe; they should not fight each other but should unite against the enemy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:28</span> Neither were they to be <b class="calibre5">terrified by</b> the enemies of the gospel. Fearlessness in the face of persecution has a twofold meaning. First, it is an omen of destruction to those who fight against God. Secondly, it is a sign <b class="calibre5">of salvation</b> to those who brave the wrath of the foe. <b class="calibre5">Salvation</b> is probably used here in its future tense, referring to the eventual deliverance of the saint from trial and the redemption of his body as well as his spirit and soul.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:29</span> The Philippians should remember that it is a privilege <b class="calibre5">to suffer</b> for <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> as well as <b class="calibre5">to believe in Him.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Dr. Griffith John wrote that once when he was surrounded by a hostile heathen crowd and was beaten, he put his hand to his face and when he withdrew it, saw that it was bathed in blood. “He was possessed by an extraordinary sense of exaltation, and he rejoiced that he had been counted worthy to suffer for His Name.” Is it not remarkable that even suffering is exalted by Christianity to such a lofty plane? Truly, even “an apparent trifle burns with the fire immortal when it is in communion with the Infinite.” The cross dignifies and ennobles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:30</span> The connection of this verse with the previous one is better understood if we supply the words “Since you are engaged in”:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">The privilege of suffering for Christ has been granted to you, since you are engaged in <b class="calibre5">the same</b> kind of <b class="calibre5">conflict which you saw in me</b> when I was in Philippi <b class="calibre5">and now hear</b> that I am still waging.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-26" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-11">III. EXHORTATION TO UNITY BASED ON CHRIST’S EXAMPLE OF HUMILITY AND SACRIFICE (2:1–16)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft">Although the church at Philippi was exemplary in many respects, and Paul had occasion to commend the saints warmly, yet there was an undercurrent of strife. There was a difference of opinion between two women, Euodia and Syntyche (4:2). It is helpful to keep this in mind because in chapter 2 the apostle is dealing directly with the cause and cure of contentions among the people of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:1</span> The <b class="calibre5">if</b> in this verse is not the “if” of doubt but of argument. The verse lists four great considerations which should draw believers together in harmony and cooperation. The apostle is saying, in effect: “<i class="calibre3">Since</i> there is so much encouragement <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>, <i class="calibre3">since</i> His <b class="calibre5">love</b> has such a tremendous persuasiveness, <i class="calibre3">since</i> <b class="calibre5">the</b> Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> brings us all together in such a wonderful <b class="calibre5">fellowship</b>, and <i class="calibre3">since</i> there is so much tender <b class="calibre5">affection and mercy</b> in Christianity, we should all be able to get along in happy harmony with one another.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">F. B. Meyer describes these four motives as:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. The persuasiveness of Christ.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. The tender care that love gives.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. The sharing of the Spirit.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="4">4. Humaneness and pity.<a id="calibre_link-50" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-12">9</a></li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">It is clear that the apostle is making an appeal for unity based on common devotion to Christ and common possession of the Holy Spirit. With all that there is <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b>, the members of His Body should have unity of purpose, affection, accord, sympathy.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:2</span> If these foregoing arguments carry any weight with the Philippians, then Paul begs them, on the basis of such arguments, that they should <b class="calibre5">fulfill</b> his <b class="calibre5">joy</b>. Up to this time, the Philippians had indeed given Paul much joy. He does not deny that for a moment, but now he asks that they should fill the cup of his joy to overflowing. They could do this <b class="calibre5">by being like-minded, having the same love</b>, and <b class="calibre5">being of one accord</b> and <b class="calibre5">of one mind.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Does this mean that all Christians are expected to think and act alike? The word of God nowhere gives such a suggestion. While we are definitely expected to agree on the great fundamentals of the Christian faith, it is obvious that on many minor matters there will be a great deal of difference of opinion. <i class="calibre3">Uniformity</i> and <i class="calibre3">unity</i> are not the same thing. It is possible to have the latter without the former. Although we might not agree on minor matters, yet we can submerge our own opinions, where no real principle is involved, for the good of others.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">To be <b class="calibre5">like-minded</b> really means to have the mind of Christ, to see things as He would see them, and to respond as He would respond. To have <b class="calibre5">the same love</b> means to show <b class="calibre5">the same love</b> to others that the Lord has shown to us, a love that did not count the cost. To be <b class="calibre5">of one accord</b> means to work together in harmony toward a common goal. Finally, to be <b class="calibre5">of one mind</b> means to act so unitedly as to show that Christ’s mind is directing our activities.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:3</span> <b class="calibre5">Nothing</b> whatever should <b class="calibre5">be done through selfish ambition or conceit</b>, since these are two of the greatest enemies of unity among the people of God. <b class="calibre5">Selfish ambition</b> is the desire to be number one, no matter what the cost. <b class="calibre5">Conceit</b> speaks of pride or self-display. Wherever you find people who are interested in gathering a clique around themselves or in promoting their own interests, there you will find the seeds of contention and strife. The remedy is found in the latter part of the verse. <b class="calibre5">In lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.</b> This does not mean that we must consider criminals as having better moral characters than our own, but rather that we should live for others unselfishly, putting their interests above our own. It is easy to read an exhortation like this in the word of God, but quite another thing to appreciate what it really means, and then put it into actual practice. To <b class="calibre5">esteem others better than</b> ourselves is utterly foreign to the human mind, and we cannot do it in our own strength. It is only as we are indwelt and empowered by the Holy Spirit that it can ever be practiced.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:4</span> The cure of troubles among the people of God is to be more concerned with the <b class="calibre5">interests of others</b> than with the things of our <b class="calibre5">own</b> lives. In a very real way the word <b class="calibre5">others</b> forms the key of this chapter. It is as we give our lives in devoted service for others that we rise above the selfish strife of men.</p>

      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:5</span> <b class="calibre5">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</b> Paul is now going to hold up before the eyes of the Philippians the example of the Lord Jesus Christ. What kind of attitude did He exhibit? What characterized His behavior toward others? Guy King has well described the mind of the Lord Jesus as: (1) The selfless mind; (2) The sacrificial mind; (3) The serving mind. The Lord Jesus consistently thought of others.<a id="calibre_link-51" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-13">10</a></p>
      <div class="senseline">

        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Charles H. Gabriel</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:6</span> When we read that Christ Jesus was <b class="calibre5">in the form of God</b>, we learn that He existed from all eternity as <b class="calibre5">God</b>. It does not mean that He merely resembled God, but that He actually <i class="calibre3">is</i> God in the truest sense of the word.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Yet He <b class="calibre5">did not consider it robbery to be equal with God</b>. Here it is of utmost importance to distinguish between personal and positional equality with God. As to His Person, Christ always <i class="calibre3">was</i>, <i class="calibre3">is,</i> and <i class="calibre3">will be</i> equal with God. It would be impossible for Him to give that up. But positional equality is different. From all eternity Christ was positionally equal with His Father, enjoying the glories of heaven. But He <b class="calibre5">did not consider</b> this position something that He had to hold on to at all costs. When a world of lost mankind needed to be redeemed, He was willing to relinquish His positional equality <b class="calibre5">with God</b>—the comforts and joys of heaven. He <b class="calibre5">did not consider</b> them something that He had to grasp forever and under all circumstances.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus He was willing to come into this world to endure the contradiction of sinners against Himself. God the Father was never spit on or beaten or crucified. In this sense, the Father was greater than the Son—not greater as to His Person, but rather as to His position and the manner in which He lived. Jesus expressed this thought in John 14:28: “If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for My Father is greater than I.” In other words, the disciples should have rejoiced to learn that He was going home to heaven. While on earth, He had been cruelly treated and rejected. He had been in lower circumstances than His Father. In that sense, His Father was greater. But when He went back to heaven, He would be equal with the Father in <i class="calibre3">His circumstances</i> as well as in <i class="calibre3">His Person.</i></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Gifford explains:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Thus it is not the nature or essence … but the <i class="calibre3">mode of existence</i> that is described in this second clause [“did not consider it robbery to be equal with God”]; and one mode of existence may be changed for another, though the essential nature is immutable. Let us take St. Paul’s own illustration, 2 Cor. viii. 9, “Though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.” Here in each case there is a change of the <i class="calibre3">mode of existence</i>, but not of the nature. When a poor man becomes rich, his <i class="calibre3">mode of existence</i> is changed, but not his nature as man. It is so with the Son of God; from the rich and glorious <i class="calibre3">mode of existence</i> which was the fit and adequate manifestation of His divine nature, He for our sakes descended, in respect of His human life, to the infinitely lower and poorer <i class="calibre3">mode of existence</i> which He assumed together with the nature of man.<a id="calibre_link-52" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-14">11</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:7</span> <b class="calibre5">But made Himself of no reputation.</b> The literal translation is: “But He emptied Himself.” The question immediately arises, “Of what did the Lord Jesus empty Himself?”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In answering this question, one must use the greatest care. Human attempts to define this emptying have often ended by stripping Christ of His attributes of Deity. Some say, for instance, that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He no longer had all-knowledge or all-power. He was no longer in all places at one and the same time. They say He voluntarily laid aside these attributes of Deity when He came into the world as a Man. Some even say He was subject to the limitations of all men, that He became liable to error, and accepted the common opinions and myths of His day!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This we utterly deny. The Lord Jesus did not lay aside any of the attributes of God when He came into the world.</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf">He was still omniscient (all-knowing).</li>
        <li class="ul">He was still omnipresent (present in all places at one and the same time).</li>
        <li class="ull">He was still omnipotent (all powerful).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">What He did was to empty Himself of His positional equality with God and to veil the glory of Deity in a body of human flesh</i>. The glory was all there, though hidden, but it did shine forth on occasions, such as on the Mount of Transfiguration. There was no moment in His life on earth when He did not possess all the attributes of God.</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Aside He threw His most divine array,</p>
        <p class="sl">And hid His Godhead in a veil of clay,</p>
        <p class="sl">And in that garb did wondrous love display,</p>
        <p class="sll">Restoring what He never took away.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">As mentioned before, one must use great care in explaining the words “He emptied Himself.” The safest method is to let the succeeding expressions provide the explanation. He emptied Himself by <b class="calibre5">taking the form of a bondservant, and coming in the likeness of men</b>. In other words, He emptied Himself by taking upon Himself something He never had before—<i class="calibre3">humanity</i>. He did not lay aside His deity, only His place in heaven, and that only temporarily.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If He had been a mere man, this would not have been an act of emptying. We do not empty ourselves by being born into the world. But for God to become Man—that is the emptying of Himself. In fact, only God could do it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Taking the form of a bondservant.</b> The Incarnation and life of the Savior may be summarized by those lovely words of John 13:4: “Jesus … laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself.” The towel or apron is the badge of service. It was used by slaves. And it was used by the blessed Lord Jesus because He came “not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many” (Matt. 20:28). But let us pause to remind ourselves of the train of thought in this passage. There were contentions among the saints at Philippi. Paul exhorts them to have the mind of Christ. The argument, in brief, is that if Christians are willing to take the lowly place, to serve others, and to give their lives in sacrifice, there will be no quarrels. <i class="calibre3">People who are willing to die for others do not generally quarrel with them.</i></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christ always existed, but came into the world <b class="calibre5">in the likeness of men</b>, meaning “as a real Man.” The humanity of the Lord is as real as His deity. He is true God and true Man. But what a mystery this is! No created mind will ever be able to understand it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:8</span> Each section of this passage describes the increasing depth of the humiliation of God’s beloved Son. He was not only willing to leave the glory of heaven! He emptied Himself! He took the form of a bondservant! He became Man! But now we read that <b class="calibre5">He humbled Himself</b>! There was no depth to which He would not stoop to save our guilty souls. Blessed be His glorious name forever!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">He humbled Himself</b> by becoming <b class="calibre5">obedient to the point of death</b>. This is marvelous in our eyes! He obeyed even though it cost Him His life. <b class="calibre5">Obedient to the point of death</b> means He obeyed to the end. Truly He was the Merchant who went and sold all that He had to buy the pearl of great price (Matt. 13:46).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Even the death of the cross. Death</b> by crucifixion was the most shameful form of execution. It might be compared to the gallows, the electric chair, or the gas chamber—reserved only for murderers. And that was the form of <b class="calibre5">death</b> reserved for heaven’s Best when He came into this world. He was not allowed to die a natural death in bed. His was not to be an accidental death. He must die <b class="calibre5">the</b> shameful <b class="calibre5">death of the cross.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:9</span> Now there is an abrupt change. The previous verses describe what the Lord Jesus did. He took the path of self-renunciation. He did not seek a name for Himself. He humbled Himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But now we turn to a consideration of what <i class="calibre3">God</i> has done. If the Savior humbled Himself, <b class="calibre5">God also has highly exalted Him</b>. If He did not seek a name for Himself, <b class="calibre5">God has given Him the name which is above every name</b>. If He bent His knees in service to others, God has decreed that <b class="calibre5">every knee</b> shall <b class="calibre5">bow</b> to Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And what is the lesson in this for the Philippians—and for us? The lesson is that the way up is down. We should not exalt ourselves but be the servants of others, that God may exalt us in due time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">God exalted Christ by raising Him from the dead and opening the heavens to receive Him back to His own right hand. Not only that—<b class="calibre5">God has given Him the name which is above every name.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Scholars are divided as to what this <b class="calibre5">name</b> is. Some say it is the name <i class="calibre3">Jesus</i>, which contains the name of <i class="calibre3">Jehovah</i>. In Isaiah 45:22, 23, it is decreed that every knee will bow to the name of Jehovah (God).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Others feel that <b class="calibre5">the name which is above every name</b> is simply a figurative way of saying the highest place in the universe, a position of supremacy and dominion. Both explanations are acceptable.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:10</span> God was so completely satisfied with the redemptive work of Christ that He determined that <b class="calibre5">every knee should bow</b> to Him—of beings <b class="calibre5">in heaven, on earth</b>, and <b class="calibre5">under the earth</b>. This does not mean that all these beings will be saved. Those who do not <i class="calibre3">willingly</i> bow the knee to Him now will one day be <i class="calibre3">compelled</i> to do so. Those who will not be reconciled in the day of His grace will be subjugated in the day of His judgment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:11</span> In matchless grace, the Lord journeyed from glory to Bethlehem, to Gethsemane, and to Calvary. God, in return, will honor Him with universal homage and the universal acknowledgment of His lordship. Those who have denied His claims will one day admit that they have played the fool, that they have greatly erred, and that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the Lord of glory.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Before leaving this magnificent passage on the Person and work of the Lord Jesus, we should repeat that it was introduced in connection with a minor problem in the church at Philippi. Paul did not set out to write a treatise on the Lord. Rather, he was merely seeking to correct selfishness and party spirit in the saints. The cure of their condition is the mind of Christ. Paul brings the Lord into every situation. “Even in dealing with matters most delicate, distressing and distasteful,” Erdman writes, “he is able to state truth in such striking beauty as to make it appear like a precious jewel embedded in a clod of earth.”<a id="calibre_link-53" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-15">12</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:12</span> Having set forth the example of Christ in such brilliant luster, the apostle is now ready to press home the exhortation based on it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Philippians had <b class="calibre5">always obeyed</b> Paul when he was present with them. <b class="calibre5">Now much more in</b> his <b class="calibre5">absence</b>, they should <b class="calibre5">work out</b> their <b class="calibre5">own salvation with fear and trembling.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Again we come to a passage of Scripture concerning which there has been much confusion. At the outset, we should be very clear that Paul is not teaching that salvation can be earned by works. Throughout his writings, he repeatedly emphasizes that salvation is not by works but by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. What then does the verse mean?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">1. It may mean that we are to <b class="calibre5">work out</b> the salvation which God has placed within us. God has given us eternal life as a free gift. We are to live it out by lives of practical holiness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">2. <b class="calibre5">Salvation</b> here may mean the solution of their problem at Philippi. They had been plagued with squabbles and strife. The apostle has given them the remedy. Now they are to apply the remedy by having the mind of Christ. Thus they would <b class="calibre5">work out</b> their <b class="calibre5">own salvation</b>, or the solution of their difficulty.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The salvation</b> spoken of here is not that of the soul, but deliverance from the snares which would hinder the Christian from doing the will of God. In a similar vein, Vine describes it as the present entire experience of deliverance from evil.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">Salvation</i> has many different meanings in the NT. We have already noticed that in 1:19 it means deliverance from prison. In 1:28 it refers to the eventual salvation of our bodies from the very presence of sin. The meaning in any particular case must be determined in part, at least, by the context. We believe that in this passage <b class="calibre5">salvation</b> means the solution of the problem that was vexing the Philippians, that is, their contentions.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:13</span> Now Paul reminds them that it is possible for them to work out their salvation because <b class="calibre5">it is God who works in</b> them <b class="calibre5">both to will and to do for His good pleasure</b>. This means that <b class="calibre5">it is God</b> who puts within us the wish or desire to do His will in the first place. Then He also <b class="calibre5">works in</b> us the power to carry out the desire.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Here again we have the wonderful merging of the divine and human. In one sense, we are called on to work out our salvation. In another sense, it is only God who can enable us to do it. We must do our part, and God will do His. (However, this does not apply to the forgiveness of sins, or to the new birth. Redemption is wholly the work of God. We simply believe and enter in.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:14</span> As we do His good pleasure, we should do it without grumbling or questioning: “Not somehow but triumphantly.” <b class="calibre5">Complaining and disputing</b> usually lead to graver offenses.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:15</span> By refraining from complaints and disputes, we <b class="calibre5">may</b> be <b class="calibre5">blameless and harmless</b> (sincere and guileless). To be <b class="calibre5">blameless</b> means that no charge can be sustained against a person (see Dan. 6:4). A <b class="calibre5">blameless</b> person may sin, but he apologizes, confesses, and makes it right whenever possible. To be <b class="calibre5">harmless</b> here means to be sincere or without deceit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Children of God</b> should be <b class="calibre5">without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation</b>. By lives without blemish, God’s children will stand out all the more clearly against the dark background of this world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This leads Paul to think of them <b class="calibre5">as lights</b> in a dark night. The darker the night, the brighter the light appears. Christians are <b class="calibre5">lights</b> or light-bearers. They cannot create any light, but they can reflect the glory of the Lord so that others may see Jesus in them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:16</span> <b class="calibre5">Holding fast</b> (KJV “forth”) <b class="calibre5">the word of life</b>. As lights we shine, but that does not excuse us from witnessing with our voices. There should be the twofold testimony of life and lips.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If the Philippians fulfill these functions, the apostle knows he will have some ground for glorying <b class="calibre5">in the day of Christ</b>. He feels a responsibility not only to see souls saved but also to present every man perfect in Christ (Col. 1:28).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The day of Christ</b> refers to the time of His return and of the judgment of the believer’s service (1:6, 10). If the Philippians are faithful in their labor for the Lord, it will be evident in that day that Paul’s service had <b class="calibre5">not</b> been <b class="calibre5">in vain.</b></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-27" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-81">IV. THE CHRISTLIKE EXAMPLE OF PAUL, TIMOTHY, AND EPAPHRODITUS (2:17–30)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft">In the preceding section, Paul has set forth the Lord Jesus as the prime example of the lowly mind. But some might be tempted to say, “Oh, but He is God and we are only mortals.” So Paul now gives three examples of men who exhibited the mind of Christ—himself, Timothy, and Epaphroditus. If Christ is the sun, then these three are moons, reflecting the glory of the sun. They are lights in a dark world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:17</span> The apostle uses a very beautiful illustration to describe the service of the Philippians and of himself. He borrows the picture from the common practice among both Jews and pagans of pouring out <b class="calibre5">a drink offering</b> or libation over a <b class="calibre5">sacrifice</b> as it was being offered.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He speaks of the Philippians as the offerers. Their <b class="calibre5">faith</b> is the <b class="calibre5">sacrifice</b>. Paul himself is the <b class="calibre5">drink offering</b>. He would be happy to be <b class="calibre5">poured out</b> in martyrdom <b class="calibre5">on the sacrifice and service of</b> their <b class="calibre5">faith</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Williams comments:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The apostle compares the self-sacrifice and energy of the Philippians with his own, magnifying theirs and minimizing his. They were both laying down their lives for the sake of the gospel, but their action he regards as the great sacrifice, and his as only the drink offering poured out upon it. Under this beauteous figure of speech, he speaks of his possible approaching death as a martyr.<a id="calibre_link-54" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-82">13</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">If this should be his lot, he would be <b class="calibre5">glad and rejoice</b> that it should be so.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:18</span> <b class="calibre5">For the same reason</b>, the Philippians should <b class="calibre5">be glad and rejoice with</b> Paul. They should not look on his possible martyrdom as a tragedy but congratulate him on such a glorious homegoing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:19</span> Up to this point, Paul has cited two examples of self-sacrificing love—the Lord Jesus and himself. Both were willing to pour out their lives to death. Two more examples of selflessness remain—<b class="calibre5">Timothy</b> and <b class="calibre5">Epaphroditus</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle hopes <b class="calibre5">to send Timothy</b> to Philippi in the near future so that he <b class="calibre5">may be encouraged</b> by news concerning them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:20</span> Among Paul’s companions, Timothy was unique in his unselfish care for the spiritual condition of the Philippians. There was <b class="calibre5">no one</b> else whom Paul could send to them with the same confidence. This is a high commendation indeed for one as young as Timothy!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:21</span> The others had become engulfed in the ocean of <b class="calibre5">their own</b> private interests. They had become so engrossed with the cares of this life that they had no time for <b class="calibre5">the things which are of Christ Jesus</b>. Does this have a message for us today in our little world of homes, refrigerators, television sets, and other <i class="calibre3">things</i>? (See Luke 8:14.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:22</span> Timothy was the apostle’s child in the faith, and he played the part with true faithfulness. They knew <b class="calibre5">his proven character</b>, his real worth, <b class="calibre5">that as a son</b> serves with <b class="calibre5">his father</b>, so Timothy <b class="calibre5">served with</b> Paul <b class="calibre5">in</b> the work of preaching <b class="calibre5">the gospel.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:23, 24</span> Because Timothy had thus proved himself, Paul hoped <b class="calibre5">to send him</b> to the Philippians as soon as he learned the outcome of his appeal to Caesar. This is doubtless the apostle’s meaning in the expression <b class="calibre5">as soon as I see how it goes with me</b>. He hopes that his appeal will be successful, and that he will be set free so that he might visit the Philippians once more.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:25</span> Next we see the mind of Christ in <b class="calibre5">Epaphroditus</b>. Whether this is the same man as the Epaphras of Colossians 4:12, we cannot be sure. At any rate, he lived in Philippi and was a messenger for the assembly there.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul speaks of him as: (1) <b class="calibre5">my brother</b>; (2) my <b class="calibre5">fellow worker</b>; (3) my <b class="calibre5">fellow soldier</b>. The first title speaks of affection, the second of hard work, and the third of conflict. He was a man who could work with others, and this is certainly a great essential in Christian life and service. It is one thing for a believer to work independently, having everything his own way. It is far more difficult to work with others, to play “second fiddle,” to allow for individual differences, to submerge one’s own desires and opinions for the good of the group. Let us be <b class="calibre5">fellow workers</b> and <b class="calibre5">fellow soldiers!</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">In addition, Paul speaks of him as <b class="calibre5">your messenger and the one who ministered to my need</b>. This gives us another valuable clue into his personality. He was willing to do common or menial work. Many today are only interested in work that is public and pleasant. How thankful we should be for those who carry on the routine work quietly and inconspicuously! By doing the hard work, Epaphroditus humbled himself. But God exalted him by recording his faithful service in Philippians 2 for all future generations to read.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:26</span> The saints had sent Epahroditus to help Paul—a journey of at least seven hundred miles. The faithful messenger took <b class="calibre5">sick</b> as a result; indeed, he came very close to death. This caused him grave concern—not the fact that he was so sick, but the fear that the saints might hear about it. If they did, they would reproach themselves for sending him on this journey and for thus endangering his life. Surely in Epaphroditus we see “a heart at leisure from itself.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Many Christians have the unfortunate habit of dwelling at great length on their illnesses or operations. Too often this is but a manifestation of the hyphenated sins of the self-life: self-pity, self-occupation, self-display.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:27</span> Epaphroditus had been <b class="calibre5">sick</b> near to <b class="calibre5">death, but God had mercy on him</b>. This section is valuable to us for the light it throws on the subject of divine healing:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. First of all, sickness is not always the result of sin. Here is a man who was sick because of the faithful discharge of his duties (see v. 30), <b class="calibre5">“ … for the work of Christ he came close to death.”</b></li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Secondly, we learn that it is not always God’s will to heal instantly and miraculously. It appears that Epaphroditus’ illness was prolonged and his recovery gradual (see also 2 Tim. 4:20; 3 Jn. 2).</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. Thirdly, we learn that healing is a mercy from God and not something we can demand from Him as being our right.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul adds that <b class="calibre5">God had mercy</b> not only on Epaphroditus <b class="calibre5">but on</b> himself <b class="calibre5">also, lest</b> he <b class="calibre5">should have sorrow upon sorrow</b>. The apostle already had considerable grief in connection with his imprisonment. If Epaphroditus had died, he would have had additional sorrow.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:28</span> Now that Epaphroditus had recovered so well, Paul has <b class="calibre5">sent him</b> back home <b class="calibre5">the more eagerly</b>. The Philippians would <b class="calibre5">rejoice</b> to have their beloved brother back again, and this would lessen Paul’s sorrow also.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:29</span> Not only should they <b class="calibre5">receive</b> Epaphroditus joyfully, but they should also <b class="calibre5">esteem</b> this dear man of God. It is a great dignity and privilege to be engaged <b class="calibre5">in</b> the service of <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b>. The saints should recognize this, even when it concerns one with whom they are very familiar.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:30</span> As mentioned previously, Epaphroditus’ illness was directly connected with his tireless service for <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. This is of great value in the eyes of the Lord. It is better to <i class="calibre3">burn out</i> for Christ than to <i class="calibre3">rust out</i>. It is better to die in the service of Jesus than to be counted a mere statistic among those who die from illness or accident.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Does <b class="calibre5">“to supply what was lacking in your service toward me”</b> suggest that the Philippians had neglected Paul and that Epaphroditus had done what they should have done? This seems unlikely, since it was the saints at Philippi who had sent Epaphroditus to Paul in the first place.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We suggest that their lack of <b class="calibre5">service</b> refers to their <i class="calibre3">inability</i> to visit Paul in person and help him directly because of their distance from Rome. Instead of rebuking them, the apostle is merely stating that Epaphroditus did, as their representative, what they were unable to do in person.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-28" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-18">V. WARNING AGAINST FALSE TEACHERS (3:1–3)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:1</span> <b class="calibre5">Finally, my brethren</b> does not mean that Paul is about to close his Epistle. The literal meaning is “As for the rest ….” The same word is used again in 4:8.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He exhorts them to <b class="calibre5">rejoice in the Lord</b>. The Christian can always find real joy in <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b>, no matter what his circumstances may be. “The source of all his singing is high in heaven above.” Nothing can really affect his joy unless it first robs him of his Savior, and this clearly is impossible. Natural happiness is affected by pain, sorrow, sickness, poverty, and tragedy. But Christian joy rides high over all the billows of life. Proof of this is found in the fact that Paul gives this exhortation from prison. Surely we can take the advice from such a man as he!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He does not find it irksome to repeat himself to the Philippians because he knows it is for their safety. But how does he repeat himself? Does this refer to the preceding expression where he urges them to <b class="calibre5">rejoice in the Lord</b>? Or does it mean the verses to follow where he warns them against the Judaizers? We believe that the latter is in view. Three times in verse 2 he uses the word <b class="calibre5">beware</b>. To use this repetition is <b class="calibre5">not tedious</b> for him, but for them it is a true safeguard.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:2</span> They are to <b class="calibre5">beware of dogs, … of evil workers</b>, and <b class="calibre5">of the mutilation</b>. All three expressions probably refer to the same group of men—false teachers who sought to put Christians under the laws of Judaism and taught that righteousness could be obtained by law-keeping and ritual.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First of all, they were <b class="calibre5">dogs</b>. In the Bible, <b class="calibre5">dogs</b> are unclean animals. The term was used by Jews to describe Gentiles! In eastern countries, dogs were homeless creatures, running wild in the streets and scrounging food as best they could. Here Paul turns the tables and applies the term to those Jewish false teachers who were seeking to corrupt the church. They were really the ones who were living on the outside, trying to exist on rituals and ceremonies. They were “picking up the crumbs when they might sit down to a feast.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Secondly, they were <b class="calibre5">evil workers</b>. Professing to be true believers, they gained admission into Christian fellowships in order to spread their false teachings. The results of their work could only be evil.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then Paul also calls them <b class="calibre5">the mutilation</b>. This is a sarcastic term to describe their attitude toward circumcision. Doubtless they insisted that a person must be circumcised in order to be saved. But all they meant by this was the physical, literal act of circumcision. They were not at all concerned with its spiritual meaning. Circumcision speaks of death to the flesh. It means that the claims of the fleshly nature should not be allowed. While they insisted on the literal act of circumcision, they gave full rein to the flesh. There was no heart acknowledgment that the flesh had been put to death at the cross. Paul was saying that they were mere mutilators of the flesh, who did not distinguish between the ceremony and its underlying meaning.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:3</span> In contrast with these, Paul states that <b class="calibre5">we</b> (true believers) <b class="calibre5">are the circumcision</b>—not those who happen to be born of Jewish parents or who have been literally circumcised, but those who realize that the flesh profits nothing, that man can do nothing in his own strength to win God’s smile of approval. Then Paul gives three characteristics of those who are the true circumcision:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. They <b class="calibre5">worship God in</b> (or by) <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b>. That is, theirs is a true spiritual worship, not one of mere ceremonies. In true worship, a person enters into the presence of God by faith, and pours out his love, praise, adoration, and homage. Soulish worship, on the other hand, is occupied with beautiful buildings and ecclesiastical furniture, with elaborate ceremonies, with brocaded priestly garments, and with whatever appeals to the emotions.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Members of the true circumcision <b class="calibre5">rejoice</b> (or glory) <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>. He alone is the ground of their boasting. They do not pride themselves in personal attainments, in cultural background, or in faithfulness to sacraments.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. They <b class="calibre5">have no confidence in the flesh</b>. They do not think they can be saved through fleshly efforts in the first place or be kept by their own strength thereafter. They do not expect any good from their Adamic nature and are therefore not disappointed when they find none!</li>

<h2 id="calibre_link-29" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-4">VI. PAUL’S HERITAGE AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENTS RENOUNCED FOR CHRIST (3:4–14)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:4</span> As Paul thought of how these men boasted in their fleshly advantages and attainments, a smile doubtless formed on his lips. If they could brag, how much <b class="calibre5">more so</b> could he! In the next two verses, he shows how that to a pre-eminent degree he possessed those natural assets in which man normally glories. “He seemed to have belonged to almost every kind of aristocracy which excites the dreams and kindles the aspirations of men.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Concerning these two verses, Arnot has said: “The whole stock-in-trade of the self-righteous Pharisee is inventoried here. He delights to display the filthy rags and make a show of them openly.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">You will notice that Paul speaks of: pride of ancestry (v. 5a); pride of orthodoxy (v. 5b); pride of activity (v. 6a); pride of morality (v. 6b).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:5</span> Here, then, is the list of Paul’s natural and fleshly advantages:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ul3f"><b class="calibre5">circumcised the eighth day</b>—he was a Jew by birth, not an Ishmaelite or a convert to Judaism;</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">of the stock of Israel</b>—a member of God’s chosen earthly people;</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">of the tribe of Benjamin</b>—a tribe that was considered an aristocratic leader (Judg. 5:14), and the one that gave Israel its first king;</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">a Hebrew of the Hebrews</b>—he belonged to that segment of the nation that had held onto its original language, customs, and usages;</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">concerning the law, a Pharisee</b>—the Pharisees had remained orthodox, whereas the Sadducees had abandoned the doctrine of the resurrection;</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">3:6 concerning zeal, persecuting the church</b>—Paul sincerely thought that he had been doing God’s service when he had attempted to wipe out the “sect” of Christians. He saw in it a threat to his own religion and therefore felt he must exterminate it;</li>
        <li class="ul3l"><b class="calibre5">concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless</b>—this cannot mean that Paul had perfectly kept the law. He confesses in Romans 7:9, 10 that such was not the case. He speaks of himself as being <b class="calibre5">blameless</b>, not sinless. We can only conclude that when Paul had violated any part of the law, he was careful to bring the sacrifice required. In other words, he had been a stickler in seeking to observe the rules of Judaism to the letter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus, as to birth, pedigree, orthodoxy, zeal, and personal righteousness, Saul of Tarsus was an outstanding man.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:7</span> But now the apostle makes the great renunciation. Here he gives us his own “Profit and Loss Statement.” On one side he lists the above-mentioned items, the things that had been <b class="calibre5">gain to</b> him. On the other side he writes the single word <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. They all amount to nothing when compared with the treasure which he had found in Christ. He <b class="calibre5">counted</b> them <b class="calibre5">loss for Christ</b>. Guy King says, “All financial gain, all material gain, all physical gain, all intellectual gain, all moral gain, all religious gain—all these are no gains at all compared with the Great Gain.”<a id="calibre_link-55" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-5">14</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">As long as he trusted in these things, he could never have been saved. Once he was saved, they no longer meant anything to him because he had seen the glory of the Lord, and all other glories seemed like nothing in comparison.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:8</span> In coming to Christ for salvation, Paul had renounced <b class="calibre5">all things</b> and counted them worthless when compared to <b class="calibre5">the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus</b>, his <b class="calibre5">Lord. The excellence of the knowledge</b> is a Hebrew way of saying “the excellent knowledge” or “the surpassing worth of knowing.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Ancestry, nationality, culture, prestige, education, religion, personal attainments—all these the apostle abandoned as grounds for boasting. Indeed, he counted <b class="calibre5">them as</b> dung or <b class="calibre5">rubbish</b> in order that he might <b class="calibre5">gain Christ.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Although the present tense is used in this verse and in the one following, Paul is looking back primarily to the time of his conversion. In order to <b class="calibre5">gain Christ</b>, he had had to turn his back on the things he had always been taught to prize most highly. If he were to have Christ as his gain, he had to say “good-bye” to his mother’s religion, his father’s heritage, and his own personal attainments.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">And so he did! He completely severed his ties with Judaism as a hope of salvation. In doing so, he was disinherited by his relatives, disowned by his former friends, and persecuted by his fellow countrymen. He literally <b class="calibre5">suffered the loss of all things</b> when he became a Christian.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Because the present tense is used in verse 8, it sounds as if Paul was still seeking to <b class="calibre5">gain Christ</b>. Actually, he had won Christ when he first acknowledged Him as Lord and Savior. But the present tense indicates that this is still his attitude—he still counts all else <b class="calibre5">as rubbish</b> when compared to the value of knowing the Lord Jesus. The great desire of his heart is: “That Christ may be my gain.” Not gold, or silver, or religious reputation, but Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:9</span> <b class="calibre5">And be found in Him</b>. Here again it sounds as if Paul was still trying to be found in Christ. The fact is that he is looking back to the tremendous decision which faced him before he was saved. Was he willing to abandon his own efforts to earn salvation, and simply trust in Christ? He had made his choice. He had abandoned all else in order to be found in Christ. The moment he believed on the Lord Jesus, he stood in a new position before God. No longer was he seen as a child of sinful Adam, but now he was seen <i class="calibre3">in Christ</i>, enjoying all the favor which the Lord Jesus enjoys before God the Father.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Likewise he had renounced the filthy rags of his own self-righteousness, which he had sought to win by keeping the law, and had chosen the <b class="calibre5">righteousness</b> of <b class="calibre5">God</b> which is bestowed on everyone who receives the Savior. <b class="calibre5">Righteousness</b> is here spoken of as a garment or covering. Man needs righteousness in order to stand before God in favor. But man cannot produce it. And so, in grace, God gives <i class="calibre3">His own</i> <b class="calibre5">righteousness</b> to those who receive His Son as Lord and Savior. “He (God) made Him (Christ) who knew no sin <i class="calibre3">to be</i> sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him” (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Again we would like to emphasize that verses 8 and 9 do not suggest that Paul had not yet received the righteousness of God. On the contrary, this became his possession when he was regenerated on the road to Damascus. But the present tense simply indicates that the results of that important event continued up to the present and that Paul still considered Christ to be worth far more than anything he had given up.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:10</span> As we read this verse, we come to the supreme emotion of the apostle’s life. F. B. Meyer calls it “The Soul’s Quest for the Personal Christ.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The most frequent treatment of this passage is to “spiritualize” it. By this is meant that <b class="calibre5">sufferings, death,</b> and <b class="calibre5">resurrection</b> are not to be taken literally. Rather, they are used to describe certain spiritual experiences, such as mental suffering, dying to self, and living the resurrected life, etc. However, we would like to suggest that the passage should be taken literally. Paul is saying he wants to live as Christ lived. Did Jesus suffer? Paul wants to suffer too. Did Jesus die? Then Paul wants to die by martyrdom in his service for Christ. Did Jesus rise from among the dead? Then Paul wishes to do the same. He realized that the servant is not above his Master. Thus, he desired to follow Christ in <b class="calibre5">His sufferings, death,</b> and <b class="calibre5">resurrection</b>. He does not say that all must adopt this view, but for him there could be no other pathway.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">That I may know Him</b>. To <b class="calibre5">know Him</b> means to gain practical day-by-day acquaintance with Him in such an intimate way that the apostle himself would become more Christlike. He wants the life of Christ to be reproduced in himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And the power of His resurrection</b>. The <b class="calibre5">power</b> that raised the Lord from the dead is set forth in Scripture as the greatest display of might which the universe has ever seen (Eph. 1:19, 20). It would seem as if all the hosts of evil were determined to keep His body in the tomb. God’s mighty power defeated this infernal army by raising the Lord Jesus from the dead on the third day. This same <b class="calibre5">power</b> is placed at the disposal of all believers (Eph. 1:19), to be appropriated by faith. Paul is stating his ambition to experience this power in his life and testimony.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And the fellowship of His sufferings.</b> It takes divine strength to suffer for Christ. That is why <b class="calibre5">the power of His resurrection</b> is put before <b class="calibre5">the fellowship of His sufferings</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the life of the Lord, suffering preceded glory. So then it must be in the life of Paul. He must share Christ’s <b class="calibre5">sufferings</b>. He realized that there would be nothing of an atoning value in his own sufferings as there was in Christ’s, but he knew, too, that it would be inconsistent for him to live in luxury and ease in a world where his Lord was rejected, scourged, and crucified. Jowett comments: “He was not contented to share the triumph of Olivet; he wanted to feel something of the pang and chill and loneliness of Gethsemane.”<a id="calibre_link-56" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-6">15</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Being conformed to His death</b>. As mentioned before, this is usually explained as meaning that Paul wanted to live the crucified life, to die practically to sin, self, and the world. But we feel that such an interpretation robs the passage of its shocking force. It does mean that, but also much more. Paul was a passionately devoted follower of the One who died on the cross of Calvary. Not only that, he was present when the first martyr of the Christian church died; in fact, he was an accomplice in murdering him! We believe Paul was actually anxious to pour out his life in the same way. Perhaps he would have felt embarrassed to meet Stephen in heaven if he had come by any more comfortable route than martyrdom. Jowett agrees:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">Many Christians are satisfied with expenditure in which there is no “shedding of blood.” They give away what they can easily spare. Their gifts are detached things, and the surrender of them necessitates no bleeding. They engage in sacrifice as long as it does not involve life; when the really vital is demanded, they are not to be found. They are prominent at all triumphant entries, and they willingly spend a little money on colorful decorations—on banners and palm branches; but when “Hurrahs” and “Hosannas” change into ominous murmurs and threats, and Calvary comes into sight, they steal away into safe seclusion.</p>
        <p class="bql">But here is an Apostle who joyfully anticipates this supreme and critical demand. He is almost impatient at his own dribblings of blood-energy in the service of the kingdom! He is eager if need be to pour it out!<a id="calibre_link-57" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-7">16</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">In a similar vein Hudson Taylor wrote:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">There is a needs-be for us to give <i class="calibre3">ourselves</i> for the life of the world…. Fruit-bearing involves cross-bearing. “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone.” We know how the Lord Jesus became fruitful—not by bearing His cross only, but by dying on it. Do we know much of fellowship with Him in this? There are not two Christs—an easy-going Christ for easy-going Christians, and a suffering, toiling Christ for exceptional believers. There is only one Christ. Are we willing to abide in Him and so to bear fruit?<a id="calibre_link-58" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-8">17</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Finally, C. A. Coates says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The knowledge of Christ in glory was the supreme desire of Paul’s heart, and this desire could never exist without producing an intense longing to reach Him in the place where He is. Hence the heart that longs after Him instinctively turns to the path by which He reached that place in glory, and earnestly desires to reach Him in that place by the very path which He trod. The heart asks, “How did <i class="calibre3">He</i> reach that glory? Was it through resurrection? And did not sufferings and death necessarily precede resurrection?” Then the heart says, “Nothing would please me so well as to reach Him in resurrection glory by the very path which took <i class="calibre3">Him</i> there.” It is the martyr spirit. Paul wanted to tread as a martyr the pathway of suffering and death, that he might reach resurrection and glory by the same path as the blessed One who had won his heart.<a id="calibre_link-59" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-9">18</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:11</span> Here again we are faced with a problem of interpretation. Are we to take this verse literally, or are we to spiritualize it? Various explanations have been offered, the principal of which are as follows:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Paul was not sure that he would be raised from the dead, so he was straining every muscle to insure his participation in the resurrection. Such a view is impossible! Paul always taught that resurrection was by grace and not by human works. In addition, he expressed the definite confidence that he would participate in the resurrection (2 Cor. 5:1–8).</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Paul was not speaking of a physical resurrection at all, but was referring to his desire to live the resurrection life while still here on earth. Perhaps the majority of commentators hold this view.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. Paul was talking about physical resurrection, but he was not expressing any doubt about his participation in it. Rather he was saying that he was not concerned about the sufferings that might lie before him en route to the resurrection. He was willing to undergo severe trials and persecutions, if that was what lay between the present time and the resurrection. The expression <b class="calibre5">“if, by any means”</b> does not necessarily express doubt (see Acts 27:12; Rom. 1:10; 11:14), but strong desire or expectation that does not count the cost.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2">We agree with the third interpretation. The apostle wanted to be conformed to Christ. Since Christ had suffered, died, and been raised from among the dead, Paul wanted nothing better than this for himself. We fear that our own desire for comfort, luxury, and ease often causes us to remove the sharp, cutting edges of some of these Bible verses. Would it not be safer to take them at their face value—literally—unless that sense is impossible in the light of the rest of the Bible?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Before leaving this verse, we should notice that Paul is speaking of <b class="calibre5">the resurrection from</b> <i class="calibre3">among</i> <b class="calibre5">the dead</b>. This is not a resurrection of all the dead. Rather, it describes a <b class="calibre5">resurrection</b> in which some will be raised, but others will remain in the grave. We know from 1 Thessalonians 4:13–18 and 1 Corinthians 15:51–57 that believers will be raised at the coming of Christ (some at the Rapture and some at the end of the Tribulation), but the rest of the dead will not be raised until after Christ’s Thousand-Year Reign on earth (cf. Rev. 20:5).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:12</span> The apostle did not consider that he was <b class="calibre5">already perfected. Perfected</b> refers not to the resurrection in the previous verse, but to the whole subject of conformity to Christ. He had no idea that it was possible to achieve a state of sinlessness or to arrive at a condition in life where no further progress could be achieved. He realized that “satisfaction is the grave of progress.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus he pressed on in order that the purpose for which the Lord Jesus had saved him might be fulfilled in him. The apostle had been apprehended by <b class="calibre5">Christ Jesus</b> on the road to Damascus. What was the purpose of this momentous meeting? It was that Paul might from then on be a pattern-saint, that God might show through him what Christ can do in a human life. He was not yet perfectly conformed to Christ. The process was still going on, and Paul was deeply exercised that this work of God’s grace might continue and deepen.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:13</span> This man who had learned to be content with whatever material things he had (4:11) never could be content with his spiritual attainments. He did <b class="calibre5">not count</b> himself to have “arrived,” as we would say today. What then did he do?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">But one thing I do.</b> He was a man of single purpose. He had one aim and ambition. In this he resembled David, who said, “One thing have I desired of the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Forgetting those things which are behind</b> would mean not only his sins and failures but also his natural privileges, attainments, and successes which he had described earlier in this chapter, and even his spiritual triumphs.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And reaching forward to those things which are ahead</b>: namely, the privileges and responsibilities of the Christian life, whether worship, service, or the personal development of Christian character.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:14</span> Looking at himself as a runner in a race, Paul describes himself as exerting every effort <b class="calibre5">toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The goal</b> is the finish line at the end of the race track. <b class="calibre5">The prize</b> is the award presented to the winner. Here <b class="calibre5">the goal</b> would be the finish of life’s race, and perhaps more particularly the Judgment Seat of Christ. <b class="calibre5">The prize</b> would be the crown of righteousness which Paul elsewhere describes as the prize for those who have run well (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The upward call of God in Christ Jesus</b> includes all the purposes that God had in mind in saving us. It includes salvation, conformity to Christ, joint-heirship with Him, a home in heaven, and numberless other spiritual blessings.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-30" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-78">VII. EXHORTATION TO A HEAVENLY WALK, AS EXEMPLIFIED BY THE APOSTLE (3:15–21)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:15</span> <b class="calibre5">As many as are mature</b> should share Paul’s willingness to suffer and die for Christ and to bend every effort in the quest for likeness to the Lord Jesus. This is the mature view of the Christian faith. Some would call it extreme, radical, or fanatical. But the apostle states that those who are full-grown will see that this is the only sane, logical, reasonable response to the One who shed His life-blood for them on Calvary.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">If in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal even this to you.</b> Paul realizes that not all will agree with him in adopting such a dangerous philosophy. But he expresses the confidence that if a person is really willing to know the truth of the matter, <b class="calibre5">God will reveal</b> it to him. The reason we have such an easy-going, complacent Christianity today is because we do not want to know the truth; we are not willing to obey the demands of ideal Christianity. <b class="calibre5">God</b> is willing to show the truth to those who are willing to follow it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:16</span> Then the apostle adds that, in the meantime, we should live up to whatever light the Lord has given us. It would not do to mark time until we came to a fuller knowledge of what is required of us as Christians. While we wait for the Lord to reveal the full implications of the cross to us, we should obey whatever <b class="calibre5">degree</b> of truth we have received.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:17</span> Now Paul turns to exhortation, first by encouraging the Philippians to be followers, or imitators of himself. It is a tribute to his exemplary life that he could ever write such words. We often hear the expression in jest, “Do as I say, not as I do.” Not so the apostle! He could hold up his own life as a model of wholehearted devotion to Christ and to His cause.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Lehman Strauss comments:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Paul considered himself the recipient of God’s mercy that he might be a “pattern”; thus his whole life, subsequent to his conversion, was dedicated to presenting to others an outline sketch of what a Christian should be. God saved Paul in order that he might show by the example of his conversion that what Jesus Christ did for him He can and will do for others. Was not this the special object our Lord had in view in extending His mercy to you and me? I believe He has saved us to be a pattern to all future believers. Are we serving as examples of those who have been saved by His grace? May it be so!<a id="calibre_link-60" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-79">19</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And note those who so walk, as you have us for a pattern</b>. This refers to any others who were living the same kind of life as Paul. It does not mean to mark them out disapprovingly, as in the next verse, but to observe them with a view to following in their steps.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:18</span> Just as verse 17 describes those whom believers <i class="calibre3">should</i> follow, this passage tells of those we <i class="calibre3">should not</i> follow. The apostle does not identify these men specifically. Whether they were the Judaizing false teachers mentioned in verse 2, or professed Christian teachers who turned liberty into license, and used grace as a pretext for sin, he does not say.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul had warned the saints about these men previously, and he does so again with <b class="calibre5">weeping</b>. But why the tears in the midst of such a stern denunciation? Because of the harm these men did among the churches of God. Because of the lives they ruined. Because of the reproach they brought on the name of Christ. Because they were obscuring the true meaning of the cross. Yes, but also because true love weeps even when denouncing <b class="calibre5">the enemies of the cross of Christ</b>, just as the Lord Jesus wept over the murderous city of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:19</span> These men were destined to eternal perdition. This does not mean annihilation, but the judgment of God in the lake of fire forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Their <b class="calibre5">god</b> was <b class="calibre5">their belly</b>. All their activities, even their professed religious service, were directed toward the purchase of food (and perhaps drink) for the gratification of their bodily appetite. F. B. Meyer described these men with keen insight: “There is no chapel in their life. It is all kitchen.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Their <b class="calibre5">glory</b> was <b class="calibre5">in their shame</b>. They boasted in the very things they should have been ashamed of—their nakedness and their immoral behavior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">They were occupied with <b class="calibre5">earthly things</b>. For them, the important things in life were food, clothing, honor, comfort, and pleasure. Eternal issues and heavenly things did not disturb their groveling in the muck of this world. They carried on as if they were going to live on earth forever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:20</span> The apostle now contrasts the heavenly-minded attitude of the true believer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">At the time the Epistle was written, Philippi was a colony of Rome (Acts 16:12). The Philippians were citizens of Rome, enjoying its protection and privileges. But they were also citizens of their local government. Against this backdrop, the apostle reminds the believers that their <b class="calibre5">citizenship is in heaven</b>. Moffat translates it: “But we are a colony of heaven.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This does not mean that Christians are not <i class="calibre3">also</i> citizens of earthly countries. Other Scriptures clearly teach that we are to be subject to governments because they are ordained by God (Rom. 13:1–7). Indeed, believers should be obedient to the government in all matters not expressly forbidden by the Lord. The Philippians owed allegiance to the local magistrates, and also to the Emperor in Rome. So believers have responsibilities to earthly governments, but their first loyalty is to the Lord in heaven.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only are we citizens of heaven, but <b class="calibre5">we also eagerly wait for the Savior</b> from heaven! <b class="calibre5">Eagerly wait for</b> is strong language (in the original) to express the earnest expectation of something believed to be imminent. It means literally to thrust forward the head and neck as in anxious expectation of hearing or seeing something.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:21</span> When the Lord Jesus comes from heaven, He will change these bodies of ours. There is nothing vile or evil about the human body in itself. The evil lies in the wrong uses to which it is put.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But it is a <b class="calibre5">lowly body</b>, a body of humiliation. It is subject to wrinkles, scars, age, suffering, sickness, and death. It limits and cramps us!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Lord will <b class="calibre5">transform</b> it into a body of glory. The full extent of the meaning of this we do not know. It will no longer be subject to decay or death, to the limitations of time or of natural barriers. It will be a real body, yet perfectly suited to conditions in heaven. It will be like the resurrection <b class="calibre5">body</b> of the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This does not mean that we will all have the same physical appearance! Jesus was distinctly recognizable after His resurrection, and doubtless each individual will have his or her own individual physical identity in eternity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Also, this passage does not teach that we shall be like the Lord Jesus as far as the attributes of God are concerned. We shall never have all-knowledge or all power; neither shall we be in all places at one and same time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But we shall be morally like the Lord Jesus. We shall be forever free from sin. This passage does not give us enough to satisfy our curiosity, but it is enough to inspire comfort and stimulate hope.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">According to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself.</b> The transformation of our bodies will be accomplished by the same divine power which the Lord will later use <b class="calibre5">to subdue all things to Himself</b>. He is “able to save” (Heb. 7:25). He is “able to aid” (Heb. 2:18). He is “able to keep” (Jude 24). Now in this verse we learn that He is <b class="calibre5">able to subdue</b>. “This is … our God forever and ever: He will be our guide even to death” (Ps. 48:14).</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-31" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-67">VIII. APPEAL FOR HARMONY, MUTUAL ASSISTANCE, JOY, FORBEARANCE, PRAYERFULNESS, AND A DISCIPLINED THOUGHT LIFE (4:1–9)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:1</span> On the basis of the wonderful hope which the apostle had set before the minds of the believers in the previous verse, he now exhorts them to <b class="calibre5">stand fast in the Lord</b>. This verse is filled with endearing names for the believers. First of all, Paul calls them his <b class="calibre5">brethren</b>. But not only his brethren—his <b class="calibre5">beloved brethren</b>. Then he adds the thought that he longs for them, that is, he longs to be with them again. Further, he speaks of them as his <b class="calibre5">joy and crown</b>. Doubtless he means that they are his <b class="calibre5">joy</b> at the present time and will be his <b class="calibre5">crown</b> at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Finally, he closes the verse with the expression <b class="calibre5">beloved</b>. The apostle really loved people, and doubtless this is one of the secrets of his effectiveness in the work of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:2</span> <b class="calibre5">Euodia</b> and <b class="calibre5">Syntyche</b> were women in the church at Philippi who were having difficulty getting along together. We are not given details as to the cause of their disagreement (and perhaps it is just as well!).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle uses the word <b class="calibre5">implore</b> twice to show that the exhortation is addressed just as much to one as to the other. Paul urges them <b class="calibre5">to be of the same mind in the Lord</b>. It is impossible for us to be united in all things in daily life, but, as far as the things of <b class="calibre5">the Lord</b> are concerned, it is possible for us to submerge our petty, personal differences in order that the Lord may be magnified and His work advanced.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:3</span> There is considerable speculation as to the identity of the <b class="calibre5">true companion</b> (or yoke-fellow<a id="calibre_link-61" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-68">20</a>) whom Paul addresses in this verse. Timothy and Luke have both been suggested, but Epaphroditus is probably the person spoken of. He is exhorted to <b class="calibre5">help these women who</b> had <b class="calibre5">labored</b> with Paul <b class="calibre5">in the gospel</b>. We take it that these women were Euodia and Syntyche, and that the Apostle Paul is giving what experience has proven to be sound advice. Often when two people have been quarreling, the quarrel can best be settled by taking it to an independent third party—someone with mature, spiritual judgment. It is not that he acts arbitrarily in the case and hands down a decision, but rather that by appealing to the word of God, he is able to show the contending persons the scriptural solution to their problem.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Care should be taken in interpreting the expression “[they] <b class="calibre5">labored with me in the gospel</b>.” By no stretch of the imagination can this be taken to mean that they preached the gospel with the Apostle Paul. There are many ways in which women can labor in the gospel—by hospitality to the servants of Christ, by home visitation, by teaching younger women and children—without assuming a ministry of public teaching or preaching.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Another co-laborer named <b class="calibre5">Clement</b> is mentioned. Nothing further is known of him with certainty. Then Paul mentions <b class="calibre5">the rest of</b> his <b class="calibre5">fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life</b>. This is a lovely way of expressing the eternal and unspeakable blessedness that attaches to faith in Christ and service for Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:4</span> Turning now to the entire church, Paul repeats the favorite exhortation. The secret of his exhortation is found in the words <b class="calibre5">in the Lord</b>. No matter how dark the circumstances of life may be, it is always possible for the Christian to <b class="calibre5">rejoice in the Lord</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Jowett shares his experience regarding Christian joy:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">Christian joy is a mood independent of our immediate circumstances. If it were dependent on our surroundings, then, indeed, it would be as uncertain as an unprotected candle burning on a gusty night. One moment the candle burns clear and steady, the next moment the blaze leaps to the very edge of the wick, and affords little or no light. But Christian joy has no relationship to the transient setting of the life, and therefore it is not the victim of the passing day. At one time my conditions arrange themselves like a sunny day in June; a little later they rearrange themselves like a gloomy day in November. One day I am at the wedding; the next day I stand by an open grave. One day, in my ministry, I win ten converts for the Lord; and then, for a long stretch of days, I never win one. Yes, the days are as changeable as the weather, and yet the Christian joy can be persistent. Where lies the secret of its glorious persistency?</p>
        <p class="bql">Here is the secret. “Lo! I am with you <i class="calibre3">all the days</i>.” In all the changing days, “He changeth not, neither is weary.” He is no fairweather Companion, leaving me when the year grows dark and cold. He does not choose my days of prosperous festival, though not to be found in my days of impoverishment and defeat. He does not show Himself only when I wear a garland, and hide Himself when I wear a crown of thorns. He is with me “all the days”—the prosperous days and the days of adversity; days when the funeral bell is tolling, and days when the wedding bell is ringing. “All the days.” The day of life—the day of death—the day of judgment.<a id="calibre_link-62" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-69">21</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:5</span> Now Paul urges them to <b class="calibre5">let</b> their <b class="calibre5">gentleness be known to all men</b>. This has also been translated yieldedness, sweet reasonableness, and willingness to give up one’s own way. The difficulty does not lie in <i class="calibre3">understanding</i> what is meant, but in <i class="calibre3">obeying</i> the precept <b class="calibre5">“to all men.”</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The Lord is at hand</b> may mean that the Lord is now present, or that the Lord’s coming is near. Both are true, though we favor the latter view.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:6</span> Is it really possible for a Christian to <b class="calibre5">be anxious for nothing</b>? It is possible as long as we have the resource of believing prayer. The rest of the verse goes on to explain how our lives can be free from sinful fretting. Everything should be taken to the Lord in <b class="calibre5">prayer</b>. <b class="calibre5">Everything</b> means <i class="calibre3">everything</i>. There is nothing too great or small for His loving care!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Prayer</b> is both an act and an atmosphere. We come to the Lord at specific times and bring specific requests before Him. But it is also possible to live in an <i class="calibre3">atmosphere</i> of prayer. It is possible that the mood of our life should be a prayerful mood. Perhaps the word <i class="calibre3">prayer</i> in this verse signifies the overall attitude of our life, whereas <b class="calibre5">supplication</b> signifies the specific <b class="calibre5">requests</b> which we bring to the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But then we should notice that our <b class="calibre5">requests</b> should <b class="calibre5">be made known to God with thanksgiving</b>. Someone has summarized the verse as saying that we should be “anxious in nothing, prayerful in everything, thankful for anything.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:7</span> If these attitudes characterize our lives, <b class="calibre5">the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard</b> our <b class="calibre5">hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. The peace of God</b> is a sense of holy repose and complacency which floods the soul of the believer when he is leaning hard upon God.</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Stayed upon Jehovah,</p>
        <p class="sl">Hearts are fully blessed;</p>
        <p class="sl">Finding, as He promised,</p>
        <p class="sl">Perfect peace and rest.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Frances Ridley Havergal</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft">This <b class="calibre5">peace surpasses all understanding</b>. People of the world cannot understand it at all, and even Christians possessing it find a wonderful element of mystery about it. They are surprised at their own lack of anxiety in the face of tragedy or adverse circumstances.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This <b class="calibre5">peace</b> garrisons the heart and the thought life. What a needed tonic it is, then, in this day of neuroses, nervous breakdowns, tranquilizers, and mental distress.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:8</span> Now the apostle gives a closing bit of advice concerning the thought life. The Bible everywhere teaches that we can control what we think. It is useless to adopt a defeatist attitude, saying that we simply cannot help it when our minds are filled with unwelcome thoughts. The fact of the matter is that we <i class="calibre3">can</i> help it. The secret lies in positive thinking. It is what is now a well-known principle—the expulsive power of a new affection. A person cannot entertain evil thoughts and thoughts about the Lord Jesus at the same time. If, then, an evil thought should come to him, he should immediately get rid of it by meditating on the Person and work of Christ. The more enlightened psychologists and psychiatrists of the day have come to agree with the Apostle Paul on this matter. They stress the dangers of negative thinking.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">You do not have to look very closely to find the Lord Jesus Christ in verse 8. Everything that is <b class="calibre5">true, noble, just, pure, lovely, of good report</b>, virtuous, and <b class="calibre5">praiseworthy</b> is found in Him. Let us look at these virtues one by one: <b class="calibre5">True</b> means not false or unreliable, but genuine and real. <b class="calibre5">Noble</b> means honorable or morally attractive. <b class="calibre5">Just</b> means righteous, toward both God and man. <b class="calibre5">Pure</b> would refer to the high moral character of a person’s life. <b class="calibre5">Lovely</b> has the idea of that which is admirable or agreeable to behold or consider. <b class="calibre5">Of good report</b> has also been translated “of good repute” or “fair sounding.” <b class="calibre5">Virtue</b>, of course, speaks of moral excellence; and <b class="calibre5">praiseworthy</b>, something that deserves to be commended.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In verse 7, Paul had assured the saints that God would garrison their hearts and thoughts in Christ Jesus. But he is not neglectful to remind them that they, too, have a responsibility in the matter. God does not garrison the thought-life of a man who does not <i class="calibre3">want</i> it to be kept pure.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:9</span> Again the Apostle Paul sets himself forth as a pattern saint. He urges the believers to practice <b class="calibre5">the things which</b> they <b class="calibre5">learned</b> from him and which they <b class="calibre5">saw in</b> his life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The fact that this comes so closely after verse 8 is significant. Right living results from right thinking. If a person’s thought-life is pure, then his life will be pure. On the other hand, if a person’s mind is a fountain of corruption, then you can be sure that the stream that issues from it will be filthy also. And we should always remember that if a person thinks an evil thought long enough, he will eventually do it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Those who are faithful in following the example of the apostle are promised that <b class="calibre5">the God of peace will be with</b> them. In verse 7, the peace of God is the portion of those who are prayerful; here the <b class="calibre5">God of peace</b> is the Companion of those who are holy. The thought here is that God will make Himself very near and dear in present experience to all whose lives are embodiments of the truth.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-32" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-20">IX. PAUL’S THANKS FOR FINANCIAL GIFTS FROM THE SAINTS (4:10–20)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:10</span> In verses 10–19, Paul speaks of the relationship which existed between the church at Philippi and himself in connection with financial assistance. No one could ever tell how meaningful these verses have been for saints of God who have been called upon to go through times of financial pressure and reverses!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul rejoices that <b class="calibre5">now at last</b>, after a period of time had elapsed, the Philippians had sent him practical assistance in the work of the Lord. He does not blame them for the period of time in which no help was received; he gives them credit that they wanted to send gifts to him but that they <b class="calibre5">lacked opportunity</b> to do so. Moffatt translates: “For what you lacked was never the care but the chance of showing it.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:11</span> In handling the whole subject of finances, it is lovely to see the delicacy and courtesy which Paul employs. He does not want them to think that he is complaining about any shortage of funds. Rather, he would have them know that he is quite independent of such mundane circumstances. He had <b class="calibre5">learned … to be content</b>, no matter what his financial condition might be. Contentment is really greater than riches, for “if contentment does not produce riches, it achieves the same object by banishing the desire for them.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">“It is a blessed secret when the believer learns how to carry a high head with an empty stomach, an upright look with an empty pocket, a happy heart with an unpaid salary, joy in God when men are faithless” (Selected).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:12</span> Paul knew <b class="calibre5">how to be abased</b>, that is, by not having the bare necessities of life; and he also knew <b class="calibre5">how to abound</b>, that is, by having more given to him at a particular time than his immediate needs required. <b class="calibre5">Everywhere and in all things</b> he had <b class="calibre5">learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need</b>. How had the apostle <b class="calibre5">learned</b> such a lesson? Simply in this way: he was confident that he was in the will of God. He knew that wherever he was, or in whatever circumstances he found himself, he was there by divine appointment. If he was <b class="calibre5">hungry</b>, it was because God wanted him to be hungry. If he was <b class="calibre5">full</b>, it was because his Lord had so planned it. Busily and faithfully engaged in the service of his King, he could say, “Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:13</span> Then the apostle adds the words which have been a puzzle to many: <b class="calibre5">“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”</b> Could he possibly mean this literally? Did the apostle really believe that there was nothing he could not do? The answer is this: When the Apostle Paul said that he could <b class="calibre5">do all things</b>, he meant <b class="calibre5">all things</b> which were God’s will for him to do. He had learned that the Lord’s commands are the Lord’s enablements. He knew that God would never call on him to accomplish some task without giving the necessary grace. <b class="calibre5">All things</b> probably applies not so much to great feats of daring as to great privations and hungerings.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:14</span> In spite of what he had said, he wants the Philippians to know that they <b class="calibre5">have done well</b> in having <b class="calibre5">shared in</b> his <b class="calibre5">distress</b>. This probably meant the money they sent to supply his needs during his imprisonment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:15</span> In the past, the <b class="calibre5">Philippians</b> had excelled in the grace of <b class="calibre5">giving</b>. During the early days of Paul’s ministry, <b class="calibre5">when</b> he <b class="calibre5">departed from Macedonia, no church shared with</b> him financially except the Philippians.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is remarkable how these seemingly unimportant details are recorded forever in God’s precious word. This teaches us that what is given to the Lord’s servants is given to the Lord. He is interested in every cent. He records all that is done as to Him, and He rewards with good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:16</span> <b class="calibre5">Even</b> when he was <b class="calibre5">in Thessalonica,</b> they <b class="calibre5">sent aid once and again for</b> his needs. It is apparent that the Philippians were living so close to the Lord that He was able to direct them in their giving. The Holy Spirit placed a burden on their hearts for the Apostle Paul. They responded by sending money to him <b class="calibre5">once and again</b>, that is, twice. When we remember that Paul was in Thessalonica only a short time, it makes their care for him there all the more remarkable.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:17</span> The utter unselfishness of Paul is indicated in this verse. He was more elated by their gain than by their <b class="calibre5">gift</b>. Greater than his desire for financial help was his longing that <b class="calibre5">fruit</b> should abound <b class="calibre5">to</b> the <b class="calibre5">account</b> of the believers. This is exactly what happens when money is given to the Lord. It is all recorded in the account books and will be repaid a hundredfold in a coming day.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">All that we have belongs to the Lord, and when we give to Him, we are only giving Him what is His own. Christians who argue as to whether or not they should tithe their money have missed the point. A tithe or tenth part was commanded to Israelites under the law as the minimum gift. In this age of grace, the question should not be, “How much shall I give the Lord?” but rather, “How much dare I keep for myself?” It should be the Christian’s desire to live economically and sacrificially in order to give an ever-increasing portion of his income to the work of the Lord that men might not perish for want of hearing the gospel of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:18</span> When Paul says <b class="calibre5">I have all</b> he means <b class="calibre5">I have all</b> <i class="calibre3">I need</i>, <b class="calibre5">and abound</b>. It seems strange in this day of twentieth-century commercialism to hear a servant of the Lord who is not begging for money, but who, on the contrary, admits having sufficient. The unrestrained begging campaigns of the present day are an abomination in the sight of God and a reproach to the name of Christ. They are completely unnecessary. Hudson Taylor once said, “God’s work carried on in God’s way will never lack God’s resources.” The trouble today is that we have failed to distinguish between working for God and the work of God. It is possible to engage in so-called Christian service which might not be the will of God at all. Where there is an abundance of money, there is always the greatest danger of embarking on ventures which might not have the divine sanction. To quote Hudson Taylor once again: “What we greatly need to fear is not insufficient funds, but too much unconsecrated funds.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The love-gift which <b class="calibre5">Epaphroditus</b> brought from the Philippians to Paul is described as a <b class="calibre5">sweet-smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God</b>. The only other time these words are used, they refer to Christ Himself (Eph. 5:2). Paul dignifies the sacrificial giving of the Philippians by describing what it meant to God. It ascended as a fragrant <b class="calibre5">sacrifice</b> to Him. It was both <b class="calibre5">acceptable</b> and <b class="calibre5">well pleasing</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Jowett exclaims:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">How vast, then, is the range of an apparently local kindness! We thought we were ministering to a pauper, and in reality we were conversing with the King. We imagined that the fragrance would be shut up in a petty neighborhood, and lo, the sweet aroma steals through the universe. We thought we were dealing only with Paul, and we find that we were ministering to Paul’s Savior and Lord.<a id="calibre_link-63" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-21">22</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:19</span> Now Paul adds what is perhaps the best-known and best-loved verse in this entire chapter. We should notice that this promise follows the description of their faithful stewardship. In other words, because they had given of their material resources to God, even to the point where their own livelihood was endangered, <b class="calibre5">God</b> would <b class="calibre5">supply</b> their every <b class="calibre5">need</b>. How easy it is to take this verse out of context and use it as a soft pillow for Christians who are squandering their money on themselves with seldom a thought for the work of God! “That’s all right. God will supply all your need.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">While it is true in a general sense that <b class="calibre5">God</b> does <b class="calibre5">supply</b> the needs of His people, this is a specific promise that those who are faithful and devoted in their giving to Christ will never suffer lack.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It has often been remarked that God supplies the needs of His people—not <i class="calibre3">out of</i> His riches, <b class="calibre5">but according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus</b>. If a millionaire gave a dime to a child, he would be giving <i class="calibre3">out of</i> his riches. But if he gave a hundred thousand dollars to some worthy cause, he would be giving <i class="calibre3">according to</i> his riches. God’s supply is <b class="calibre5">according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus</b>, and nothing could be richer than that!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Williams calls verse 19 a note drawn upon the bank of faith:</p>
      <ul class="calibre4">
        <li class="ul3f"><b class="calibre5">My God</b>—the name of the Banker.</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">Shall supply</b>—the promise to pay.</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">All your need</b>—the value of the note.</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">According to His riches</b>—the capital of the bank.</li>
        <li class="ul1"><b class="calibre5">In glory</b>—the address of the bank.</li>
        <li class="ul3l"><b class="calibre5">By Christ Jesus</b>—the signature at the foot, without which the note is worthless.<a id="calibre_link-64" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-22">23</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:20</span> Thinking of God’s abundant provision causes the apostle to break out into praise. This is suitable language for every child of God who daily experiences God’s gracious care, not only in the supply of material things, but also in providing guidance, help against temptation, and the quickening of a languishing devotional life.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-33" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-40">X. CLOSING GREETINGS (4:21–23)</a></h2>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:21</span> Thinking of the believers as they are gathered together and listening to the Letter which he was writing them, Paul greets <b class="calibre5">every saint in Christ Jesus</b> and sends greeting from <b class="calibre5">the brethren who are with</b> him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:22</span> We are compelled to love this verse for its reference to <b class="calibre5">Caesar’s household</b>. Our imaginations are strongly tempted to run riot. Who are the members of Nero’s household referred to here? Were they some of the soldiers who had been assigned to watch the Apostle Paul, and who had been saved through his ministry? Were they slaves or freedmen who worked in the palace? Or might the expression include some officials of the Roman government? We cannot know with certainty, but here we have a lovely illustration of the truth that Christians, like spiders, find their way into king’s palaces (Prov. 30:28)! The gospel knows no boundaries. It can penetrate the most forbidding walls. It can plant itself in the very midst of those who are seeking to exterminate it. Truly, the gates of Hades shall not prevail against the church of Jesus Christ!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:23</span> Now Paul closes with his characteristic greeting. <b class="calibre5">Grace</b> sparkled on the first page of this Letter, and now is found again at the close. Out of the abundance of a man’s heart his mouth speaks. Paul’s heart was filled to overflowing with the greatest theme of all the ages—<b class="calibre5">the grace of</b> God through <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>—and it is not at all surprising that this precious truth should flood over into every channel of his life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul Rees concludes for us:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">The greatest of humans has written his warmest of letters. The love-task is finished. The day is done. The chain is still there upon the apostolic wrist. The soldier is still on guard. Never mind! Paul’s spirit is free! His mind is clear! His heart is glowing!</p>

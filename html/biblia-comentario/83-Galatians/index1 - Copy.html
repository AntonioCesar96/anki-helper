<h2 id="calibre_link-97" class="ahaft">I. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
      <p class="pf">A large percentage of English-speaking peoples, as well as many French people, are of Celtic origin—that is, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, or Breton. These ethnic groups especially will be fascinated to know that one of Paul’s earliest letters was written to their ancestors (“Galatia,” “Celt,” and “Gaul” are all related words).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">About 278 <span class="sm">B.C.</span> a large number of these European Gauls migrated to what is today Turkey. Their boundaries became fixed and their state was named “Galatia.” Many people think they can see “Celtic” traits in such things as the changeableness of the Galatians (in Acts 13 and Galatians 3:1, e.g.).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Be that as it may, the Epistle to the Galatians fulfills a crucial role in early Christianity. Though often seen as a “first draft” of Romans (since it covers the gospel of grace, Abraham, the law, etc., in a similar manner), Galatians is a stern, impassioned effort to save Christianity from becoming just a messianic sect of legalistic Judaism. How the Galatians themselves reacted we do not know, but the gospel of grace, apart from the works of the law, <i class="calibre3">did</i> triumph, and Christianity went on to become a global faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">During the Reformation, Galatians became so important to Luther that he referred to the book as “my Kaethe” (his affectionate name for his wife). His <i class="calibre3">Commentary on Galatians</i> influenced not merely scholars, but the common folk, and is still in print and studied.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-99" class="ah">II. Authorship</h2>
      <p class="paft">The genuineness of Galatians as a Pauline Epistle has never seriously been in question. It is quoted as Paul’s by Polycarp, Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Origen, Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria. It is listed in the Muratorian Canon as Paul’s and, probably due to its strong anti-Judaizing language, receives first place in Marcion’s <i class="calibre3">Apostolicon</i>. The <i class="calibre3">external evidence</i> is thus very strong.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3">internal evidence</i> for Paul’s authorship starts with the personal references in 1:1 and 5:2, and the remark near the end (6:11) that he wrote it in “large letters.” This is widely taken to refer to a possible eye disease of the apostle. Supporting evidence includes the fact that the Galatians once would have been willing to pluck their <i class="calibre3">eyes</i> out for Paul. Many historical notes dovetail with Acts. The dispute over circumcision and whether Paul was a real apostle were flaming issues in the ’50s and ’60s but dead issues soon afterward.</p>

<section id="calibre_link-100" type="chapter">
<h2 id="calibre_link-101" class="ah">III. Date</h2>
      <p class="paft">The date of the Epistle depends on the precise meaning of the expressions “the churches of Galatia” and “Galatians.” If it refers to the southern part of Asia Minor, an earlier date, even before the Jerusalem Council, is likely. If the northern part is meant, a later date is called for.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">Geographically</i> the term “Galatia” was used for the north and <i class="calibre3">politically</i> it was used for the south—the Roman province of Galatia.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The North Galatian theory was standard until the 1800s and is largely held by German scholars still. There is no evidence that Paul ever ministered to the “Galatians” of that area, but this certainly does not rule it out.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Especially since Sir William Ramsay made it popular, the South Galatian theory has been widely held in Great Britain and North America. Since Luke gives much space in Acts to Paul’s missionary work in this area (Antioch in Pisidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe), it would seem likely that the apostle would have written to his converts there. Since Paul evangelized southern Galatia on his First Missionary Journey and revisited it on his Second, an early date is possible for Galatians. If the letter was penned <i class="calibre3">before</i> the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15 (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 49), this would explain why the question of circumcision was still a very live issue. Theodor Zahn, a leading conservative German scholar, dates Galatians during Paul’s Second Missionary Journey, from Corinth. This would make it his very earliest Epistle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If the northern theory is correct, Galatians was probably written in the 50s, perhaps as early as 53, but probably later.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If, as we believe, the southern theory is correct, and especially if Galatians was written before Paul attended the Jerusalem Council, which decided the issue of circumcision for Gentile Christians, the book can be dated <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 48.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-103" class="ah">IV. Background and Theme</h2>
      <p class="paft">During his early missionary journeys, the Apostle Paul visited Asia Minor, preaching the glorious message that salvation is by faith in Christ alone. Many of his hearers were saved, and churches were formed, several of them in Galatia. The inhabitants of Galatia were known to be restless, warlike, and changeable.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">After Paul had left this area, false teachers entered the churches and introduced wrong doctrine. They taught that salvation was by faith in Christ <i class="calibre3">plus</i> keeping the law. Their message was a mixture of Christianity and Judaism, of grace and law, of Christ and Moses. They also tried to turn the Galatians away from Paul by saying he was not a genuine apostle of the Lord and, therefore, his message was not reliable. They sought to destroy confidence in the message by undermining confidence in the messenger. Many of the Galatian Christians were affected by their evil suggestions.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What sorrow and disappointment must have filled Paul’s heart when such news from Galatia reached him! Had his labors among these people been in vain? Could the Christians still be rescued from these Judaistic, legalistic teachings? Paul was stirred to swift and decisive action. He took up his pen and wrote this indignant letter to his beloved children in the faith. In it, he sets forth the true character of salvation as being given by grace from beginning to end, not earned by law-keeping either in whole or in part. Good works are not a condition of salvation, but a fruit of it. The Christian has died to the law; he leads a life of holiness, not by his own efforts, but by the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit of God.</p>

<section id="calibre_link-106" type="chapter">
<h2 id="calibre_link-77" class="ahaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-47">I. PERSONAL: PAUL DEFENDS HIS AUTHORITY (Chaps. 1, 2)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-78" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-48">A. Paul’s Purpose in Writing (1:1–10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:1</span> At the outset, <b class="calibre5">Paul</b> insists that his call as <b class="calibre5">an apostle</b> was divine. It did <b class="calibre5">not</b> originate with <b class="calibre5">men, nor</b> was it communicated from God <b class="calibre5">through</b> some <b class="calibre5">man.</b> It came directly <b class="calibre5">through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead</b>. A man who is thus called by God alone and is responsible to God alone has freedom to preach God’s message without fear of man. So the apostle was independent of the twelve apostles and of everybody else, both as to his message and his ministry.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In this verse, the deity of Christ is both stated and implied. It is stated in the expression <b class="calibre5">nor through man, but through Jesus Christ</b>. It is implied by the way in which Paul links together <b class="calibre5">Jesus Christ and God the Father</b>, putting them on equality with one another. Then <b class="calibre5">God the Father</b> is mentioned as the One <b class="calibre5">who raised</b> Jesus <b class="calibre5">from the dead</b>. Paul had good reason to remind the Galatians of this. The resurrection was proof of God’s complete satisfaction with the work of Christ for our salvation. Apparently, the Galatians were not wholly satisfied with the Savior’s work, because they were trying to improve on it by adding their own efforts at law-keeping.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul was called by the <i class="calibre3">risen</i> Christ, in contrast to the twelve apostles, who were called by the Lord Jesus during His earthly ministry. Ever afterward, the resurrection formed an important part of his message.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:2</span> The apostle associates himself with <b class="calibre5">all the brethren who</b> were <b class="calibre5">with</b> him. These <b class="calibre5">brethren</b> joined in appealing to the Galatians to hold on to the truth of the gospel. This Letter <b class="calibre5">to the churches of Galatia</b> shows a deliberate lack of warmth. Ordinarily Paul addressed believers as “the church of God,” “saints,” or “the faithful in Christ Jesus.” He often expressed thanks for the Christians, or praise for their virtues. Frequently he mentioned individuals by name. But there is none of that here. The seriousness of the error in the Galatian churches caused him to be stern and cool toward them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:3</span> <b class="calibre5">Grace and peace</b> are two of the great words of the gospel. <b class="calibre5">Grace</b> is God’s undeserved kindness toward ungodly sinners. Instead of asking man to <i class="calibre3">do</i>, it tells what God has <i class="calibre3">done</i>, and invites men to receive salvation as a free gift. Scofield says, “Instead of looking for good men whom it may approve, grace is looking for condemned, guilty, speechless, and helpless men whom it may save, sanctify, and glorify.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Peace</b> is the result of grace. When a sinner receives the Savior, he has <b class="calibre5">peace</b> with God. He rests in the knowledge that the penalty for his sins has been paid, that all his sins have been forgiven, and that he will never be condemned. But grace not only <i class="calibre3">saves</i>; it <i class="calibre3">keeps</i> as well. And we need not only the blessing of <i class="calibre3">peace with God</i> but <i class="calibre3">the peace of God</i> also. These are the blessings which Paul wishes for the Galatians as he opens his Letter. Surely the Galatians realized that these blessings could never come by the law. The law brought a curse on all who broke its precepts. It never brought peace to a single soul.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:4</span> Paul next reminds his readers of the tremendous cost of their salvation. Note the words: our Lord Jesus Christ, <b class="calibre5">who gave Himself for our sins</b>. If He <b class="calibre5">gave Himself</b> to settle the sin question, then it is both unnecessary and impossible for us to add to such a work, or to help atone for our sins by law-keeping. Christ is the sole and sufficient Savior. Christ died to <b class="calibre5">deliver us from this present evil age</b>. This includes not only the moral and political corruption of this age, but also the religious world which mixes rituals and ceremonies with faith in Christ. It was especially timely, therefore, for the Galatians to be reminded that they were going back into the very system from which Christ had died to rescue them! Christ’s redemption was <b class="calibre5">according to the will of our God and Father</b>. This places the credit where it belongs—not in man’s puny efforts, but rather in the sovereign will of God. It emphasizes that Christ is God’s way of salvation and that there is no other.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Verse 4 should be a reminder that God is not interested in improving the world, or making men comfortable in it, but in delivering men from it. Our priorities should coincide with His.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:5</span> According to the gospel of grace, all the <b class="calibre5">glory</b> for man’s salvation goes to God the Father and to the Lord Jesus Christ. Man cannot share this glory as a co-savior by keeping the law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Each phrase in these five verses is meaningful, much truth being expressed in a few words. Paul has stated in embryo the two main subjects which will occupy the rest of the Epistle—<i class="calibre3">his own authority as an apostle</i> and <i class="calibre3">his gospel of the grace of God</i>. He is now ready to speak directly to the Galatians concerning the problem at hand.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:6, 7</span> Paul confronts the Galatians at once on their readiness to accept error. He is amazed that they should so suddenly surrender the truth of the gospel, and he solemnly labels their action as deserting God for a false gospel. God had <b class="calibre5">called</b> them into <b class="calibre5">the grace of Christ</b>; now they were putting themselves under the curse of the law. They had accepted the true gospel; now they were abandoning it for <b class="calibre5">a different gospel</b> which was not good news at all. It was just a perverted message, a mixture of grace and law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:8, 9</span> Paul twice pronounces the solemn curse of God on anyone who preaches <b class="calibre5">any other gospel</b>. God has only one message for doomed sinners: He offers salvation by grace through faith, entirely apart from law-keeping. Those who proclaim any other way of salvation must necessarily be doomed. How very serious it is to preach a message that results in the eternal destruction of souls! Paul was not tolerant of such false teachers and neither should we be. John Stott warns:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">We are not to be dazzled, as many people are, by the person, gifts or office of teachers in the church. They may come to us with great dignity, authority and scholarship. They may be bishops or archbishops, university professors or even the pope himself. But if they bring a gospel other than the gospel preached by the apostles and recorded in the New Testament, they are to be rejected. We judge them by the gospel; we do not judge the gospel by them. As Dr. Alan Cole expresses it, “The outward person of the messenger does not validate his message; rather, the nature of the message validates the messenger.”<a id="calibre_link-17" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-49">1</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that the apostle says <b class="calibre5">an angel from heaven</b>, not “an angel from God.” <b class="calibre5">An angel from heaven</b> could conceivably bring a false message, but an angel from God could not. Language could not express more clearly the uniqueness of the gospel. It is the <i class="calibre3">only</i> way of salvation. Self-effort or human merit have no part. The gospel alone offers salvation without money or price. Whereas the law has a curse for those who fail to <i class="calibre3">keep</i> it, the gospel has a curse for those who seek to <i class="calibre3">change</i> it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:10</span> Paul is probably reminded at this point that his enemies accused him of changing the message to suit his audience, so he asks, in effect, “In insisting that there is only one gospel, am I trying to please <b class="calibre5">men, or God</b>?” Obviously he is not trying to <b class="calibre5">please men</b>, because they hate the suggestion that there is only one way to heaven. If Paul changed his message to suit <b class="calibre5">men</b>, he <b class="calibre5">would not be a bondservant of Christ</b>; in fact, he would be inviting the wrath of God to fall upon himself.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-79" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-50">B. Paul’s Defense of His Message and Ministry (1:11—2:10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:11, 12</span> The apostle now presents six arguments in defense of his message and ministry. First, the gospel was received by divine revelation and independently of man. It was <b class="calibre5">not according to man</b> in the sense that man did not originate it. A moment’s reflection will confirm this. Paul’s gospel makes everything of God and nothing of man. This is not the kind of salvation that men would devise! Paul <b class="calibre5">neither received it from</b> some other person, <b class="calibre5">nor was</b> he <b class="calibre5">taught it</b> through books. <b class="calibre5">It came</b> to him by direct <b class="calibre5">revelation</b> from <b class="calibre5">Jesus Christ</b> Himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:13, 14</span> Secondly, Paul’s failure to include Jewish law in his gospel could not be laid to any ignorance of <b class="calibre5">Judaism</b> on his part. By birth and training, he was steeped in the law. By personal choice, he became a notorious persecutor of <b class="calibre5">the church</b>. In passionate zeal <b class="calibre5">for the traditions of</b> his <b class="calibre5">fathers</b>, he surpassed many other Jews of his own age. Therefore, his gospel of salvation by faith apart from the law could certainly not be attributed to any ignorance of the law. Why then did he omit it from his preaching? Why did his gospel run counter to his background, his natural inclinations, and his whole religious development? Simply because it was not the result of his own thinking, but was given to him directly by God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:15–17</span> Thirdly, the first few years of his ministry were carried on independently of the other <b class="calibre5">apostles</b>. Paul now demonstrates his independence of other men in connection with his gospel. After his conversion, he <b class="calibre5">did not immediately confer with</b> human leaders, <b class="calibre5">nor did</b> he <b class="calibre5">go up to Jerusalem</b> where the other <b class="calibre5">apostles</b> were. Instead, he <b class="calibre5">went to Arabia</b>, then <b class="calibre5">returned again to Damascus</b>. His determination to avoid Jerusalem was not out of disrespect for his fellow-apostles; it was rather because he had been commissioned by the risen Lord Himself and given a unique ministry to the Gentiles (2:8). Hence his gospel and his service needed no human authorization. He was independent of man altogether.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Several expressions in these verses deserve careful consideration. Note the expression in verse 15: <b class="calibre5">God … separated me from my mother’s womb</b>. Paul realized that even before his birth, he had been set apart by God for a special work. He adds that God <b class="calibre5">called me through His grace</b>, referring to his conversion on the road to Damascus. If he had received what he deserved at that moment, he would have been cast into hell. But Christ, in wonderful grace, saved him and sent him out to preach the faith he had sought to destroy. In verse 16 he shows that God intended <b class="calibre5">to reveal His Son in</b> him. This gives us a wonderful view of God’s purpose in calling us—to reveal His Son in <i class="calibre3">us</i>, so that we may represent the Lord Jesus to the world. He reveals Christ to our hearts (v. 16) in order that He may display Christ through us (vv. 16–23) in order that God may be glorified in this display (v. 24). Paul’s special assignment was to preach Christ among the Gentiles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In verse 17 he says, <b class="calibre5">“I went to Arabia.”</b> Every servant of the Lord needs a time of seclusion and meditation. Moses had his forty years on the backside of the desert. David was alone with God while he tended sheep on the hillsides of Judea.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:18–20</span> Fourthly, when Paul finally visited Jerusalem, he met only <b class="calibre5">Peter</b> and <b class="calibre5">James</b>. Apart from that, he was relatively unknown to the churches in Judea (1:21–24). To demonstrate further his independence of the other apostles, Paul recounts that he did not visit Jerusalem until at least <b class="calibre5">three years</b> after his conversion. He went up to make the acquaintance of <b class="calibre5">Peter</b><a id="calibre_link-18" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-23">2</a>—a personal, not an official visit (Acts 9:26–29). While there, he also met <b class="calibre5">James, the Lord’s brother</b>. His stay with Peter lasted only <b class="calibre5">fifteen days</b>—scarcely long enough for a training course! Moreover, the text indicates he was on perfect equality with these servants of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:21–24</span> After that, he spent much of his time in <b class="calibre5">the regions of Syria and Cilicia</b>—so much so that <b class="calibre5">the churches of Judea</b> did not know him personally. All they knew was that this one who had treated the Christians so cruelly was now a Christian himself and was preaching Christ to others. Because of this <b class="calibre5">they glorified God</b> for what He had done in the life of Paul. (Do others glorify God because of the change in our lives?)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:1</span> Fifthly, during Paul’s later visit to Jerusalem, the apostles there agreed that his gospel was divine (2:1–10). Because the church began at Jerusalem, and the apostles more or less made that city their headquarters, certain Christians felt that the church there was “the mother church.” Thus Paul had to contend with the charge that he was somewhat inferior because he was not one of the Jerusalem apostles. He replies with a detailed account of his later trip <b class="calibre5">to Jerusalem</b>. Whether this was <b class="calibre5">fourteen years</b> after his conversion, or after his first trip, we do not know. We do know that he received a revelation from Christ to go, together <b class="calibre5">with Barnabas</b>, his co-worker, and <b class="calibre5">Titus</b>, a Gentile converted through Paul’s ministry. The Judaizers had insisted that Titus be circumcised for full salvation. The Apostle Paul was adamantly opposed because he realized that the truth of the gospel was at stake. (Later when Paul himself circumcised Timothy, no important principle was involved—Acts 16:3.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2">E. F. Kevan says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Paul saw that circumcision for justification was not the innocent little rite that the unthinking man might assume it to be. To undergo circumcision was to seek to be justified by a legalistic method of law-keeping, and thus to deny the very foundations of grace.<a id="calibre_link-19" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-51">3</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:2</span> When Paul reached Jerusalem he <b class="calibre5">communicated to them that gospel which</b> he preached <b class="calibre5">among the Gentiles, but privately to those who were of reputation, lest by any means</b> he <b class="calibre5">might run, or had run, in vain</b>. Why did Paul speak <b class="calibre5">privately</b> to the spiritual leaders rather than to the entire assembly? Did he want them to approve his gospel, in case he had been preaching something false? Obviously not! This is contrary to all that the apostle has been saying. He has insisted that his message was divinely revealed to him. He had no doubts that the doctrine he preached was the truth. The real explanation must be sought elsewhere. It was a matter of common courtesy to speak to the leaders first. It was also desirable that the leaders should be thoroughly convinced as to the genuineness of Paul’s gospel. If they had any questions or difficulties, Paul wanted to answer them at the outset. Then he could go before the church with the full support of the other apostles. In dealing with a large number of people, there is always the danger that emotional appeals will sway the group. Therefore, Paul desired to present his gospel <b class="calibre5">privately</b> at first, in an atmosphere free from possible mass hysteria. Had Paul acted otherwise, a serious dispute might have arisen, dividing the church into a Jewish wing and a Gentile one. Then the purpose of Paul’s trip to Jerusalem would have been defeated. This is what he means by <b class="calibre5">lest by any means I might run, or had run, in vain.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:3</span> The whole question of legalism was brought to a head in the case of <b class="calibre5">Titus</b>. Would the Jerusalem church receive this Gentile convert into fellowship, or would it insist that he first <b class="calibre5">be circumcised</b>?<a id="calibre_link-20" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-52">4</a> After considerable discussion and debate, the apostles decided that circumcision was not necessary for salvation. Paul had won a resounding victory.<a id="calibre_link-21" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-53">5</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:4</span> The underlying reason why Paul was led to go to Jerusalem is made clear by linking the beginning of verse 2 with the beginning of verse 4: “I went up by revelation … <b class="calibre5">and this occurred because of false brethren secretly brought in.”</b> This refers to what had previously taken place in Antioch (Acts 15:1, 2). Some Jewish teachers from Jerusalem, posing as Christians, had somehow been <b class="calibre5">secretly</b> brought into the church at Antioch and were teaching that circumcision was essential for salvation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:5</span> Paul and Barnabas opposed them vigorously. To settle the matter, Paul, Barnabas, and others went to Jerusalem to obtain an opinion from the apostles and elders there.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:6</span> Those who were esteemed as leaders in Jerusalem <b class="calibre5">added nothing</b> to him, either to his message or to himself as an apostle. This was remarkable. In the previous chapter, he had emphasized that his contact with the other apostles had been minimal. Now when he finally did confer with them, they agreed that he had been preaching the same gospel as they. What an important point this is! These Jewish leaders agreed that his gospel was not defective in any way. Though Paul had been independent of them, and had not been taught by them, yet the gospel they preached was exactly the same as his own. (Paul does not intend to belittle the other apostles, he simply states that <b class="calibre5">whatever they were</b>, namely, companions of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth, did not give them any superior authority in his estimation. God does not accept man’s person as far as such external distinctions are concerned.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:7, 8</span> The apostles in Jerusalem recognized that Paul had, by undeserved favor, been commissioned to take the gospel to <b class="calibre5">the uncircumcised</b> (the Gentiles) just as <b class="calibre5">Peter</b> had been sent to the Jews. Both men preached the same gospel, but primarily to different nationalities.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:9, 10</span> Even <b class="calibre5">James, Cephas</b> (Peter), and <b class="calibre5">John</b>, apparently <b class="calibre5">pillars</b> of the church, <b class="calibre5">perceived</b> that God was working through Paul, and <b class="calibre5">gave</b> him <b class="calibre5">and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship</b> in taking the gospel <b class="calibre5">to the Gentiles</b>. This was not an official ordination, but an expression of their loving interest in Paul’s work. The only suggestion they made was that Paul and Barnabas should <b class="calibre5">remember the poor, the very thing which</b> Paul states he <b class="calibre5">was eager to do.</b></p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-80" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-54">C. Paul Rebukes Peter (2:11–21)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:11</span> As Paul’s sixth and final answer to the attacks on his apostleship, he tells how it was necessary for him to rebuke the Apostle <b class="calibre5">Peter</b><a id="calibre_link-22" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-55">6</a>—considered by many Jewish Christians as the chief of the apostles. (This passage effectively refutes the notion that Peter was the infallible leader of the church.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:12</span> When Peter first came to Antioch, <b class="calibre5">he would eat with the Gentiles</b> in the full enjoyment of his Christian liberty. By Jewish tradition, he could not have done this. Some time later, a group <b class="calibre5">came</b> down <b class="calibre5">from James</b> in Jerusalem to Antioch for a visit. They claimed to represent James, but he later denied this (Acts 15:24). They were probably Jewish Christians who were still clinging to certain legal observances. When they arrived, Peter stopped having fellowship with the Gentiles, <b class="calibre5">fearing</b> that the news of his behavior would get back to the legalist faction in Jerusalem. In doing this, he was denying one of the great truths of the gospel—that all believers are one in Christ Jesus, and that national differences do not affect fellowship. Findlay says: “By refusing to eat with uncircumcised men, he affirmed implicitly that, though believers in Christ, they were still to him ‘common and unclean,’ that the Mosaic rites imparted a higher sanctity than the righteousness of faith.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:13</span> Others followed Peter’s example, including <b class="calibre5">Barnabas</b>, Paul’s valued co-laborer. Recognizing the seriousness of this action, Paul boldly accused Peter of <b class="calibre5">hypocrisy</b>. Paul’s rebuke is given in verses 14–21.<a id="calibre_link-24" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-56">7</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:14</span> As a Christian, Peter knew that God no longer recognized national differences; he had lived as a Gentile, eating their foods, and more. By his recent refusal to eat with Gentiles, Peter was implying that observance of Jewish laws and customs was necessary for holiness, and that the Gentile believers would have to <b class="calibre5">live as Jews</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:15</span> Paul seems to be using irony here. Did not Peter’s conduct betray a lingering conviction concerning the superiority of the <b class="calibre5">Jews</b>, and the despised position of the <b class="calibre5">Gentiles</b>? Peter should have known better, because God had taught him before the conversion of the Gentile Cornelius to call no man common or unclean (Acts 10 and 11:1–18).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:16</span> Jews who had been saved knew that there was no salvation in <b class="calibre5">the law</b>. The law condemned to death those who failed to obey it perfectly. This brought the curse on all, because all have broken its sacred precepts. The Savior is here presented as the only true object of faith. Paul reminds Peter that “<b class="calibre5">even we</b> <i class="calibre3">Jews</i>” came to the conclusion that salvation is <b class="calibre5">by faith in Christ and not by</b> law-keeping. What was the sense now of Peter’s putting Gentiles under the law? The law told people what to do but gave them no power to do it. It was given to reveal sin, not to be a savior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:17</span> Paul and Peter and others had sought justification in <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> and in Christ alone. Peter’s actions at Antioch, however, seemed to indicate that he was not completely justified, but had to go back under the law to complete his salvation. If this is so, then Christ is not a perfect and sufficient Savior. If we go to Him to have our sins forgiven, but then have to go elsewhere in addition, is not Christ <b class="calibre5">a minister of sin</b> in failing to fulfill His promises? If, while we are professedly depending on Christ for justification, we then go back to the law (which can only condemn us as sinners), do we act as Christians? Can we hope for Christ’s approval on such a course of action that in effect makes Him <b class="calibre5">a minister of sin</b>? Paul’s answer is an indignant <b class="calibre5">Certainly not!</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:18</span> Peter had abandoned the whole legal system for faith in Christ. He had repudiated any difference between Jew and Gentile when it came to finding favor with God. Now, by refusing to eat with Gentiles, he is building up <b class="calibre5">again</b> what he once <b class="calibre5">destroyed</b>. In so doing, he proves himself to be <b class="calibre5">a transgressor</b>. Either he was wrong in leaving the law for Christ, or he is wrong now in leaving Christ for the law!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:19</span> The penalty for breaking the law is death. As a sinner, I had broken the law. Therefore, it condemned me to die. But Christ paid the penalty of the broken law for me by dying in my place. Thus when Christ died, I died. He died to the law in the sense that He met all its righteous demands; therefore, in Christ, I too have <b class="calibre5">died to the law.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Christian has <b class="calibre5">died to the law</b>; he has nothing more to do with it. Does this mean that the believer is at liberty to break the Ten Commandments all he wants? No, he lives a holy life, not through fear of the law, but out of love to the One who died for him. Christians who desire to be under the law as a pattern of behavior do not realize that this places them under its curse. Moreover, they cannot touch the law in one point without being responsible to keep it completely. The only way we can <b class="calibre5">live to God</b> is by being dead to the law. The law could never produce a holy life; God never intended that it should. His way of holiness is explained in verse 20.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:20</span> The believer is identified <b class="calibre5">with Christ</b> in His death. Not only was <i class="calibre3">He</i> crucified on Calvary, <i class="calibre3">I</i> was <b class="calibre5">crucified</b> there as well—in Him. This means the end of me as a sinner in God’s sight. It means the end of me as a person seeking to merit or earn salvation by my own efforts. It means the end of me as a child of Adam, as a man under the condemnation of the law, as my old, unregenerate self. The old, evil “I” has been crucified; it has no more claims on my daily life. This <i class="calibre3">is</i> true as to my standing before God; it <i class="calibre3">should</i> be true as to my behavior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The believer does not cease to live as a personality or as an individual. But the one who is seen by God as having died is not the same one who lives. <b class="calibre5">It is no longer I who live, but Christ</b> who <b class="calibre5">lives in me</b>. The Savior did not die for me in order that I might go on living my life as I choose. He died for me so that from now on He might be able to live His life in me. <b class="calibre5">The life which I now live in</b> this human body, <b class="calibre5">I live by faith in the Son of God</b>. Faith means reliance or dependence. The Christian lives by continual dependence on Christ, by yielding to Him, by allowing Christ to live His life in him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus the believer’s rule of life is Christ and not the law. It is not a matter of striving, but of trusting. He lives a holy life, not out of fear of punishment, but out of love to <b class="calibre5">the Son of God, who loved</b> him <b class="calibre5">and gave Himself for</b> him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Have you ever turned your life over to the Lord Jesus with the prayer that His life might be manifest in your body?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:21</span> <b class="calibre5">The grace of God</b> is seen in His unconditional gift of salvation. When man tries to earn it, he is making it void. It is no longer by grace if man deserves it or earns it. Paul’s final thrust at Peter is effective. If Peter could obtain favor with God by Jewish observances, <b class="calibre5">then Christ died</b> for nothing; He literally threw His life away. Christ died because man could obtain <b class="calibre5">righteousness</b> in no other way—not even by law-keeping.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Clow says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">The deepest heresy of all, which corrupts churches, leavens creeds with folly, and swells our human hearts with pride, is salvation by works. “I believe,” writes John Ruskin, “that the root of every schism and heresy from which the Christian Church has suffered, has been the effort to earn salvation rather than to receive it; and that one reason why preaching is so ineffective is that it calls on men oftener to work for God than to behold God working for them.”<a id="calibre_link-25" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-57">8</a></p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-81" class="ah"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-59">II. DOCTRINAL: PAUL DEFENDS JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH (3:1—5:1)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-82" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-60">A. The Great Truth of the Gospel (3:1–9)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:1</span> Their actions exhibited a lack of understanding and reason. To turn to law from grace is to be <b class="calibre5">bewitched</b>. It is to be lulled as by a magic spell and unwarily to accept falsehood for truth. When Paul asks: <b class="calibre5">“Who has bewitched you?”</b> the <i class="calibre3">who</i> is singular (Gk. <i class="calibre3">tis</i>),<a id="calibre_link-26" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-61">9</a> not plural, perhaps suggesting that the devil was the author of this false teaching. Paul himself had preached <b class="calibre5">Jesus Christ</b> to the Galatians <b class="calibre5">as crucified</b>, emphasizing that the cross was to separate them forever from the curse and bondage of the law. How could they return to the law and thus disregard the cross? Had not the truth laid hold of them practically?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:2</span> One question should be sufficient to settle the whole matter. Let them go back to the time of their conversion—the time when the Holy Spirit came to dwell in their bodies. How <b class="calibre5">did</b> they <b class="calibre5">receive the Spirit</b>? By doing, or by believing? Obviously it was by believing. No one ever received the Spirit by keeping <b class="calibre5">the law.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:3</span> If they could not <i class="calibre3">obtain</i> salvation by works, could they expect to grow in holiness or Christian maturity by the law? If the power of <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b> was necessary to save them, could they complete the process by fleshly efforts?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:4</span> When the Galatians first trusted in Christ, they exposed themselves to bitter persecution, perhaps partly at the hands of Jewish zealots who hated the gospel of grace. Was all that suffering <b class="calibre5">in vain</b>? In going back to the law were they not saying that the persecutors were right after all? <b class="calibre5">If indeed it was in vain</b>. Paul expresses continued hope that they will return to the gospel for which they once <b class="calibre5">suffered</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:5</span> There is a question whether <b class="calibre5">He</b> (or <i class="calibre3">he</i>)<a id="calibre_link-27" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-62">10</a> in verse 5 refers to God, to Paul, or to someone else who was ministering to the Galatians at the time he was writing the Letter. Ultimately, it must apply to God, since only <b class="calibre5">He</b> can supply <b class="calibre5">the</b> Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b>. However, in a secondary sense, it could apply to a Christian worker as the instrument through whom God performs His will. This would give a very exalted view of the Christian ministry. Someone has said: “Real Christian work of any sort is conveying the Holy Spirit to others; it is actually the dispensing of the Spirit.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If the apostle is speaking of himself, he is probably thinking of the miracles which accompanied his preaching and their reception of Christ (Heb. 2:4). However, the tense of the verb indicates not something that happened in the past, but something going on at the time of writing. Paul is probably referring to the miraculous gifts bestowed by the Holy Spirit on believers after their conversion, as described in 1 Corinthians 12:8–11.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</b> The answer is: <b class="calibre5">By the hearing of faith</b>. The indwelling of the Holy Spirit and His subsequent work in the believer are never earned nor merited, but are always given by grace and received by <b class="calibre5">faith</b>. Thus the Galatians should have realized from their own experiences that blessing comes by faith and not by law-keeping.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">For his second proof, Paul now turns to the very Scriptures which the false teachers were using to show the necessity of circumcision! What did the OT really say?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:6</span> Paul had demonstrated that God’s dealings with the Galatians were entirely on the basis of faith. Now he shows that men were saved in the same way even in OT times. The question in verse 5 was: “Does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?” The answer was: “By the hearing of faith.” With that answer in mind, verse 6 opens, <b class="calibre5">just as Abraham</b> …. He was justified in the same way—by the hearing of faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Perhaps the Jewish teachers were using Abraham as their hero and example, basing their argument for the necessity of circumcision on his experience (Gen. 17:24, 26). If so, Paul will fight them on their own ground. How then was Abraham saved? <b class="calibre5">Abraham believed God.</b> It was not by any meritorious act at all. He simply <b class="calibre5">believed God</b>. There is no merit attached to that; in fact, a man is a fool not to believe God. Believing God is the only thing man can do in connection with salvation, which leaves him no ground for boasting. It is not a “good work,” involving human effort. It gives no place to the flesh. What is more right than for a creature to trust his Creator or a child his Father?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Justification is an act of God by which He declares righteous all who believe on Him. God can properly deal with sinners in this way because Christ died as a substitute for sinners on Calvary’s cross, paying the debt of their sins. Justification does not mean that God makes the believer righteous and sinless in himself. He reckons him to be righteous on the basis of the work of the Savior. God gives the trusting sinner a righteous standing which makes him fit for heaven, then expects him to live righteously in gratitude for what He has done for him. The important thing to note here is that justification has nothing to do with law-keeping. It is entirely on the principle of faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:7</span> Doubtless the Jewish teachers were maintaining that in order to be real sons of Abraham, the Galatians had to be circumcised. Paul refutes this. The real <b class="calibre5">sons of Abraham</b> are not those who are born Jews, or those who become Jewish converts, but those who are saved by faith. In Romans 4:10, 11, Paul shows that Abraham was reckoned righteous <i class="calibre3">before</i> he was circumcised. In other words, he was justified while he was still on <i class="calibre3">Gentile</i> ground.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:8</span> The OT is depicted as a prophet, looking down the centuries and <b class="calibre5">foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles</b> as well as Jews on the principle of <b class="calibre5">faith</b>. The blessing of <b class="calibre5">the Gentiles by faith</b> was not only foreseen by the OT, but was actually announced to Abraham in Genesis 12:3—“In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When we first read this quotation from Genesis, we find it difficult to see how Paul found such a meaning in it. Yet the Holy Spirit, who wrote that verse in the OT, knew that it contained the gospel of salvation by faith to all nations. Since Paul was writing by inspiration of the same Holy Spirit, he was enabled to explain to us the underlying meaning: <b class="calibre5">In you</b>—that is, along with Abraham, in the same way as Abraham. <b class="calibre5">All the nations</b>—the Gentiles as well as the Jews. <b class="calibre5">Shall be blessed</b>—be saved. How was Abraham saved? <b class="calibre5">By faith.</b> How will the nations be saved? In the same way as Abraham—by faith. Moreover, they will be saved as Gentiles, not by becoming Jews.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:9</span> All <b class="calibre5">those who</b> exercise <b class="calibre5">faith</b> in God <b class="calibre5">are</b> justified <b class="calibre5">with believing Abraham</b>, according to the testimony of the Jewish Scriptures.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-83" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-63">B. Law Versus Promise (3:10–18)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:10</span> Paul shows from the Sacred Writings that, far from conferring a blessing, the law can only <b class="calibre5">curse</b>. This verse does not say “As many as have broken the law,” but: <b class="calibre5">As many as are of the works of the law</b>, that is, all who seek to obtain favor with God on the basis of obeying the law. They <b class="calibre5">are under the curse</b>, that is, condemned to death. <b class="calibre5">For it is written</b> (in Deut. 27:26), <b class="calibre5">“Cursed is everyone who does not continue….”</b> It is not enough to keep the law for a day, or a month, or a year. One must <b class="calibre5">continue</b> to keep it. Obedience must be complete. It is not enough to keep just the Ten Commandments. All six hundred and some laws in the five books of Moses must be obeyed!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:11</span> The false teachers are once again refuted from the OT. Paul quotes the prophet Habakkuk to show that God has always justified men <b class="calibre5">by faith</b> and not by law. The quotation in the original Greek word order reads: “The just (or righteous) by faith shall live.” In other words, those who have been reckoned righteous by faith, not by works, shall have eternal life. The justified-by-faith-ones <b class="calibre5">shall live.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:12</span> The law does not ask men to believe. It does not even ask men to <i class="calibre3">try</i> to keep the commandments. It calls for strict, complete, and perfect obedience, as was so clearly taught in Leviticus. It is a contrary principle to faith. The law says: “Do and live.” Faith says: “Believe and live.” Paul’s argument then is this: The just person shall live by faith. A person under <b class="calibre5">law</b> does <b class="calibre5">not</b> live by <b class="calibre5">faith</b>. Therefore, he is not <i class="calibre3">just</i> before God. When Paul says: <b class="calibre5">“The man who does them shall live by them,”</b> he is stating a theoretical axiom or ideal but one that is impossible to attain.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:13</span> To redeem is to buy back, or to deliver by paying the price. <b class="calibre5">The curse of the law</b> is death—the penalty for breaking its commandments. Christ has delivered those under law from paying the penalty of death demanded by the law. (Paul is undoubtedly speaking primarily of believing Jews when he uses the pronoun <b class="calibre5">us</b>, although the Jews were representatives of the entire human race.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Cynddylan Jones says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The Galatians imagined that Christ only half purchased them, and that they had to purchase the rest by their submission to circumcision and other Jewish rites and ceremonies. Hence their readiness to be led away by false teachers and to mix up Christianity and Judaism. Paul says here: (according to the Welsh translation) “Christ hath <i class="calibre3">wholly</i> purchased us from the curse of the law.”<a id="calibre_link-28" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-64">11</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Christ redeemed</b> men by dying in their place, enduring the dreadful wrath of God against sins. The <b class="calibre5">curse</b> of God fell on Him as man’s Substitute. He did not become sinful in Himself, but man’s sins were placed upon Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christ did not redeem men <b class="calibre5">from the curse of the law</b> by keeping the Ten Commandments perfectly during His lifetime. Scripture does not teach that His perfect obedience to the law is reckoned to us. Rather He delivered men from the law by bearing its dreadful curse in death. Apart from His death there could be no salvation. The law taught that when condemned criminals were hanged on a tree, it was a sign of their being under the curse of God (Deut. 21:23). Here the Holy Spirit sees in that passage a prophecy of the manner in which the Savior would die to bear the curse for His creatures. He was hung between heaven and earth as though unworthy of either. In His death by crucifixion, He is said to have been hanged <b class="calibre5">on a tree</b> (Acts 5:30; 1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:14</span> God had promised to bless Abraham and to bless all the world through him. <b class="calibre5">The blessing of Abraham</b> is really salvation by grace through faith. The penalty of death required by God must first be paid. So the Lord Jesus was made a curse in order that God might reach out to both Jews and Gentiles in grace. Now in Christ (a descendant of Abraham), the nations are blessed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3 does not mention the Holy Spirit. But Paul tells us here, by inspiration of God, that the gift of the Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> was included in God’s unconditional covenant of salvation with Abraham. It was there in embryo. The Holy Spirit could not come as long as the law was in the way. Christ had to die and be glorified before the Spirit could be given (John 16:7).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle has demonstrated that salvation is by faith, not law, by (1) the experience of the Galatians, and (2) the witness of the OT Scriptures. He now turns to an illustration from everyday life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul’s argument in this section may be summarized as follows: In Genesis 12:3, God promised to bless all families of the earth in Abram. This promise of salvation included Gentiles as well as Jews. In Genesis 22:18, God also promised: “In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.” He said <i class="calibre3">seed</i> (singular), not “seeds” (plural). God was referring to One Person, the Lord Jesus Christ, who was a direct descendant of Abraham (Luke 3:34). In other words, God promised to bless all nations, Gentile as well as Jewish, through Christ. The promise was unconditional; it required neither good works nor legal obedience. It was a simple promise meant to be received in simple faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Now the law, given to Israel 430 years later, could not add conditions to the promise nor alter it in any way. In human affairs this would be unrighteous; in divine matters it would be unthinkable. The conclusion therefore is that God’s promise of blessing to the Gentiles is through Christ, by faith, and not by law-keeping.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:15</span> In human affairs, when a <b class="calibre5">covenant</b> or will is signed and sealed, no one would think of changing the document or adding to it. If human testaments cannot be broken, how much less can God’s!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:16</span> No doubt the Judaizers had argued that although the promises were originally made to Abraham and to his seed (the people of Israel) by faith, yet these same people of Israel were subsequently put under the law. Therefore, the Galatians, though originally saved by faith, must now observe the Ten Commandments. Paul answers: <b class="calibre5">The promises</b> were made <b class="calibre5">to Abraham and his Seed</b> (singular). “Seed” may sometimes denote a multitude, yet here it denotes one Person, namely, Christ. (We ourselves would probably never see this in reading the OT, but the Spirit of God enlightens us.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:17</span> God’s promise to Abraham was unconditional; it did not depend on works at all. God simply agreed to give Abraham a Seed (Christ). Though he had no child, Abraham believed God, thus believing also in the Christ to come, and he was justified. The coming of the <b class="calibre5">law—four hundred and thirty years later</b> could not affect <b class="calibre5">the promise</b> of salvation in any way. It could neither revoke the promise nor add conditions to it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Perhaps the Judaizers were suggesting that the law, coming 430 years after the promise, had the effect of annulling it. “Not at all!” Paul says, in effect: “The promise was like a will, and had been ratified by a death (the covenant sacrifice, Gen. 15:7–11; see also Heb. 9:15–22). It could not be revoked.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The 430 years are reckoned from the time that God confirmed the Abrahamic Covenant to Jacob, just as Jacob was preparing to enter Egypt (Gen. 46:1–4), and they extend to the giving of the law about three months after the exodus.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:18</span> <b class="calibre5">The inheritance</b> must be either by faith or by works. It cannot be by both. Scripture makes it clear that it was given <b class="calibre5">to Abraham by</b> unconditional <b class="calibre5">promise</b>. So it is with salvation. It is offered as an unconditional gift. Any thought of working for it is excluded.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-84" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-65">C. The Purpose of the Law (3:19–29)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:19</span> <b class="calibre5">What purpose then does the law serve?</b> If, as Paul contended, the law did not annul or add conditions to the promise God made to Abraham, <b class="calibre5">what</b> <i class="calibre3">was</i> the <b class="calibre5">purpose</b> of <b class="calibre5">the law</b>? The law was intended to reveal sin in its true character as transgression. Sin existed before the law, but man did not recognize it as transgression until the law came. Transgression is the violation of a known law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The law was given to a nation of sinners. They could never obtain righteousness by keeping it because they did not have the power to obey it. The law was meant to show men what hopeless sinners they were, so they would cry out to God to save them by His grace. God’s covenant with Abraham was an unconditional promise of blessing; the law resulted only in cursing. The law demonstrated the unworthiness of man to receive free and unconditional blessing. If man is to be blessed, it must be by the grace of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The Seed</b> is Christ. Therefore, the law was given as a temporary measure until the coming of Christ. The promised Abrahamic blessing was to come through Him. A contract between two parties involves <b class="calibre5">a mediator</b>, a go-between. The law involved two contracting parties—God and Israel. Moses served as go-between (Deut. 5:5). The angels were God’s messengers in delivering the law to Moses (Deut. 33:2; Ps. 68:17; Acts 7:53; Heb. 2:2). The participation of Moses and the angels spoke of distance between God and His people, of a people unfit for His presence.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:20</span> If there was only one contracting party, and he made an unconditional promise, requiring nothing from the other party, there would be no need of <b class="calibre5">a mediator</b>. The fact that the law required a mediator implied that man must keep his part of the agreement. This was the weakness of the law; it called for obedience from those who did not have the power to give it. When <b class="calibre5">God</b> made His promise to Abraham, He was the sole contracting Party. This was the strength of the promise: everything depended on God and nothing on man. No mediator was involved, because none was needed.<a id="calibre_link-29" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-66">12</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:21</span> Did <b class="calibre5">the law</b> set aside <b class="calibre5">the promises</b> or take their place? <b class="calibre5">Certainly not!</b> If it were possible to give <b class="calibre5">a law</b> by which sinners could achieve the perfection required by God, then certainly salvation would have been by law-keeping. God would not have sent the Son of His love to die for sinners if He could have achieved the same result in some less costly way. But the law had plenty of both <i class="calibre3">time</i> and <i class="calibre3">people</i> to demonstrate that it could not save sinners. In this sense it was “weak through the flesh” (Rom. 8:3). All the law could do was show men their hopelessness and impress on them that salvation could only be by the free grace of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:22</span> The OT showed that all men are sinners, including those under the law. It was necessary that man should be thus thoroughly convinced of sin, in order <b class="calibre5">that the promise</b> of salvation <b class="calibre5">by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe</b>. The key words in verse 22 are <b class="calibre5">faith, given</b>, and <b class="calibre5">believe</b>. There is no mention of “doing” or “law-keeping.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:23</span> <b class="calibre5">Faith</b> here is the Christian faith. It refers to the era ushered in by the death, burial, resurrection, and ascension of the Lord Jesus, and the preaching of the gospel at Pentecost. Before that time, the Jews <b class="calibre5">were kept under guard</b> as if in a prison or in custody. They were fenced in by the law’s requirements, and since they could not fulfill these, they were restricted to the way of <b class="calibre5">faith</b> for salvation. The people under law were thus confined until the glorious news of deliverance from the bondage of the law was announced in the gospel.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:24</span> <b class="calibre5">The law</b> is pictured as a guardian and guide of children, or as a <b class="calibre5">tutor</b>.<a id="calibre_link-30" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-67">13</a> This emphasizes the thought of teaching; the law taught lessons concerning the holiness of God, the sinfulness of man, and the need for atonement. Here the word is used to describe one who exercises discipline and general supervision over minors, or the immature.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The words <b class="calibre5">to bring us</b> are not in the original, but were supplied by the translators of the King James tradition. If we leave them out, the verse teaches that the law was a Jewish guardian up <b class="calibre5">to Christ</b>, that is, until the coming of Christ, or with the coming of Christ in view. There is a sense in which the law preserved the people of Israel as a distinct nation by regulations concerning marriage, property, foods, and so on. When “the faith” came, it was first announced to this nation that had been so miraculously kept in ward through the centuries. Justification <b class="calibre5">by faith</b> was promised on the basis of the finished work of Christ, the Redeemer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:25</span> The law is the <b class="calibre5">tutor</b>, but once the Christian <b class="calibre5">faith</b> has been received, believing Jews <b class="calibre5">are no longer under</b> the law. How much less Gentiles, such as the Galatians, who were <i class="calibre3">never</i> under the tutor! Verse 24 teaches that man is <i class="calibre3">not justified by law</i>; verse 25 teaches that the <i class="calibre3">law is not the rule of life</i> for one who is justified.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:26</span> Notice the change in pronouns from “we” to <b class="calibre5">you</b>. In speaking of the Jews as “we,” Paul showed that they were kept under law until the coming of Christ. The law maintained them as a separate people to whom justification by faith might be preached. When they were justified, they ceased to be under law, and their distinctive character as Jews ceased. The pronoun <b class="calibre5">“you”</b> from here to the end of the chapter includes both saved Jews and saved Gentiles. Such people <b class="calibre5">are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:27</span> Union with <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>, which takes place at the time of conversion, is confessed in water baptism. This baptism does not make a person a member of Christ or an inheritor of the kingdom of God. It is a public identification with Christ, which Paul speaks of as a “putting on” of <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. Just as a soldier proclaims himself a member of the army by “putting on” his uniform, so a believer identifies himself as one who belongs to Christ by being <b class="calibre5">baptized</b> in water. By this act he publicly expresses submission to Christ’s leadership and authority. He portrays visibly that he is a son of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is certain that the apostle is <i class="calibre3">not</i> suggesting that water baptism unites a person to Christ. That would be a blatant repudiation of his basic thesis that salvation is by faith alone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Nor is Paul likely referring here to Spirit baptism, which places a believer in the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13). The baptism of the Holy Spirit is invisible. There is nothing about it that corresponds to a public “putting on” of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is a baptism that is <i class="calibre3">unto</i> Christ (JND). Just as the Israelites were baptized <i class="calibre3">unto</i> Moses, identifying themselves with him as their leader, so believers today are baptized <i class="calibre3">unto</i> Christ, signifying their recognition of Him as rightful Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">By baptism the believer signifies also the burial of the flesh and its efforts to obtain righteousness. He signifies the end of the old way of life and the beginning of the new one. In water baptism the Galatians confessed that they had died with Christ and had been buried with Him. Just as Christ died to the law, so they were dead to the law, and should not therefore desire to be under it as a rule of life. Just as Christ has, by His death, broken down the distinction between Jew and Gentile, so they have died to such national differences. They <b class="calibre5">have put on Christ</b> in the sense that they now live a completely new life—the life of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:28</span> The law made distinctions between these classes. For instance, the distinction between Jew and Gentile is insisted on in Deuteronomy 7:6; 14:1, 2. In his morning prayer, a Jewish man thanked God that He had not made him a Gentile, a slave, or a woman. <b class="calibre5">In Christ Jesus</b> these differences disappear, that is, as far as acceptance with God is concerned. A Jew is not preferred over a Gentile, a free man is not more favored than a slave, nor is a man more privileged than a woman. All are on the same level because they are <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse must not be pressed into meaning something it does not say. As far as everyday life is concerned (not to mention public ministry in the church), God <i class="calibre3">does</i> recognize the distinction between male and female. The NT contains instructions addressed to each; it also speaks separately to slaves and masters. But in obtaining blessing from God, these things do not matter. The great thing is to be <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>. (This refers to our heavenly position, not to our earthly condition.) Before God the believing Jew is not a bit superior to the converted pagan! Govett says: “All the distinctions which the law made are swallowed up in the common grave which God has provided.” Therefore, how foolish it is for Christians to seek further holiness by setting up differences which Christ has abolished.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:29</span> The Galatians were deluded into thinking that they could become Abraham’s seed by keeping the law. Paul shows otherwise. Christ is the seed of Abraham; the inheritance promised to Abraham was fulfilled in Christ. When sinners believe on Him, they become one with Him. Thus they become <b class="calibre5">Abraham’s seed</b> and, in Christ, they inherit all of God’s blessings.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-85" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-68">D. Children and Sons (4:1–16)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:1, 2</span> The picture is of a wealthy father who intends to turn over control of his wealth to the son when he reaches maturity. However, <b class="calibre5">as long as he is</b> still <b class="calibre5">a child</b>, the heir’s status is like that of <b class="calibre5">a slave</b>. He is continually told to do this and not to do that. He has <b class="calibre5">stewards</b> who manage his property and <b class="calibre5">guardians</b> in charge of his person. Thus, although the inheritance is surely his, he does not enter into it until he has grown up.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:3</span> This was the condition of the Jews under law. They <b class="calibre5">were children</b>, being ordered around by the law just like slaves. They <b class="calibre5">were in bondage</b> under the <b class="calibre5">elements of the world</b>, meaning the elementary principles of the Jewish religion. The ceremonies and rituals of Judaism were designed for those who did not know God the Father as He is revealed in Christ. An illustration might be found in a child learning the rudiments of spelling by using blocks, or learning to identify objects by means of pictures. The law was full of shadows and pictures, appealing to the spiritual senses by means of the physical and external. Circumcision is an example of this. Judaism was physical, external, and temporal; Christianity is spiritual, internal, and permanent. These externals were a form of <b class="calibre5">bondage</b> to the <b class="calibre5">children.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:4</span> <b class="calibre5">The fullness of the time</b> refers to the time appointed by the Heavenly Father when the heirs would become of age (see v. 2).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In this verse we have, in a few words, a marvelous statement as to the deity and humanity of the Savior. He is the eternal Son of God; yet He <b class="calibre5">was born of a woman</b>. If Jesus had been only a man, it would be gratuitous to say that He <b class="calibre5">was born of a woman</b>. How else could a mere man be born? The expression, in our Lord’s case, witnesses to His unique Person and the unique mode of His birth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Born into the world as an Israelite, He was therefore <b class="calibre5">born under the law</b>. As Son of God, the Lord Jesus would never have been under the law; He was the One who gave it. But, in condescending grace, He put Himself <b class="calibre5">under the law</b> that He had made, in order that He might magnify it in His life, and bear its curse in His death.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:5</span> The law demanded a price from those who failed to keep it—the price of death. Before God could bring men into the wonderful position of sonship, this price had to be paid. So the Lord Jesus, coming into the world as a member of the human race and of the Jewish nation, and paid the price that the law demanded. Because He is God, His death was infinite in value, that is, it was sufficient to pay for any number of sinners. Because He was Man, He could die as a substitute for man. Govett says: “Christ, by nature Son of God, became Son of man, that we, by nature sons of man, might become sons of God. Wonderful exchange!”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As long as men were slaves, they could not be <b class="calibre5">sons</b>. Christ delivered them from the bondage of the law in order that they might be adopted <b class="calibre5">as sons</b>. Notice here the distinction between becoming a <i class="calibre3">child</i> of God and a <i class="calibre3">son</i> of God (compare Rom. 8:14, 16). The believer is born into the family of God as a <i class="calibre3">child</i> (see John 1:12). The emphasis here is on the fact of divine birth, not on the privileges and responsibilities of sonship. The believer is adopted into the family as a <i class="calibre3">son</i>. Every Christian is a son immediately and is brought into the inheritance of which he is an heir. Thus the instructions to Christians in the NT assume no infancy among the saints. All are treated as mature sons.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Adoption</b> in Roman culture differed from that in modern life. We think of adoption as taking someone else’s child to be one’s own. But in the NT, <b class="calibre5">adoption</b> means putting believers into the position of mature sons with all the privileges and responsibilities of that position.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:6</span> In order that those who <b class="calibre5">are sons</b> of God might realize the dignity of this position, <b class="calibre5">God sent</b> the Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> at Pentecost to indwell them. The Spirit creates an awareness of sonship, causing the saint to address God as <b class="calibre5">Father. “Abba, Father”</b> is a familiar form of address, combining the Aramaic and Greek words for “father.” No slave could address the head of a family in this fashion; it was reserved for members of the family, and expresses love and confidence. Note the Trinity in this verse—<b class="calibre5">Spirit, Son,</b> and <b class="calibre5">Father</b>, in that order.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:7</span> The believer is <b class="calibre5">no longer a slave</b>; he is not under the law. Now he is <b class="calibre5">a son</b> of God. Since Christ, as God’s Son, is the heir of all God’s riches, the Christian is <b class="calibre5">an heir of God through Christ</b>.<a id="calibre_link-31" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-69">14</a> All that God has is his by faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In rabbinical schools in Israel today a student is not allowed to read the Song of Solomon or Ezekiel 1 until he is forty years old. The Song of Solomon is considered too sexually explicit for a younger mind, and Ezekiel 1 contains a description of the glory of the ineffable God. The Talmud tells that when a certain person under forty began to read Ezekiel 1, fire came out from the page and consumed him. What this shows is that a person under law is not considered a <i class="calibre3">man</i> until he is forty. (The well-known <i class="calibre3">bar mitzvah</i> at age thirteen only makes a Jewish boy a “son of the covenant”—the meaning of the term—and thus responsible to keep the law.) Up to the age of forty the Orthodox man is considered a minor.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not so with believers under grace. The moment they are saved the whole inheritance is theirs. They are treated as adult, mature sons and daughters, and the whole Bible is theirs to read, enjoy, and obey.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In light of these truths Harrison’s exhortation is very appropriate:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Child of His love, all things are yours—He tells you this in 1 Corinthians 3:22, 23 to arouse you to a realization of riches beyond your utmost powers of imagination to comprehend. Consider the universe. Whose is it, but His and yours? Then live royally.<a id="calibre_link-32" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-70">15</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:8</span> The Galatians had once been under bondage to idols. Before their conversion, they had been heathens who worshiped idols of wood and stone—false <b class="calibre5">gods</b>. Now they were turning to another type of bondage—bondage to the law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:9</span> <b class="calibre5">How</b> could they excuse their conduct? They had come to know <b class="calibre5">God</b>, or, if they didn’t know Him in a deep experiential way, at least they were <b class="calibre5">known by</b> Him, that is, they were saved. Yet they were turning from His power and riches (of which they were heirs) <b class="calibre5">to weak and</b> poor things, the things connected with the law, such as circumcision, holy days, and rules of diet. They were again putting themselves <b class="calibre5">in bondage</b> to things that could neither save nor enrich but could only impoverish them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul labels the law and all its ceremonies as <b class="calibre5">weak and beggarly</b>. God’s laws were beautiful in their time and place, but they are positive hindrances when substituted for the Lord Jesus. It is idolatry to turn from Christ to law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:10, 11</span> The Galatians were observing the Jewish calendar with its Sabbaths, its festivals, <b class="calibre5">and seasons</b>. Paul expresses fear for those who profess to be Christians, yet seek to find favor with God by legal observances. Even unregenerate people can observe <b class="calibre5">days and months and years.</b> It gives some people intense satisfaction to feel there is something they can do in their own strength to win God’s smile. But this implies that man has some strength, and hence, to that extent, he does not need the Savior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If Paul could write in this manner to the Galatians, what would he write to professing Christians today who are seeking to attain holiness by legal observances? Would he not condemn the traditions brought into Christianity from Judaism—a humanly ordained priesthood, distinctive vestments for the priest, Sabbath-keeping, holy places, candles, holy water, and so forth?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:12</span> Apparently the Galatians had forgotten their gratitude to Paul when he first preached the gospel to them. But he addresses them as <b class="calibre5">“Brethren”</b> in spite of their failures and his fears for them. Paul had been a Jew under law. Now, in Christ, he was free from the law. So he says, <b class="calibre5">“Become like me</b>—delivered from the law and no longer living under it.” The Gentile Galatians had never been under law, and were not under it now. Thus the apostle says: <b class="calibre5">“I became like you</b>. I, who was a Jew, now enjoy the freedom from law which you Gentiles always had.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">You have not injured me at all.</b> It is not exactly clear what Paul had in mind here. Perhaps he is saying that he had no feeling of personal injury as a result of their treatment of him. That they should have turned away from him to the false teachers was not so much a blow at him personally as a blow at the truth of God and thus an injury to their own selves.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:13</span> The <b class="calibre5">gospel</b> was <b class="calibre5">first … preached</b> to them in <b class="calibre5">physical infirmity.</b><a id="calibre_link-33" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-71">16</a> God often uses weak, despised, poor instruments to accomplish His work in order that the glory will be His and not man’s.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:14</span> Paul’s illness was a <b class="calibre5">trial</b> to himself and to those who listened to him. However, the Galatians did not reject him because of his physical appearance or because of his speech. Instead, they <b class="calibre5">received</b> him <b class="calibre5">as an angel of God</b>, that is, a messenger sent by God, and <b class="calibre5">even as Christ Jesus</b> Himself. Since he represented the Lord, they received him as they would receive the Lord (Matt. 10:40). They accepted Paul’s message as the very word of God. This should be a lesson to all Christians concerning their treatment of the Lord’s messengers. When we receive them cordially, we receive Him in the same way (Luke 10:16).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:15</span> When they first heard the gospel, they acknowledged what a rich <b class="calibre5">blessing</b> it was to their souls. So great was their appreciation that they would have given their <b class="calibre5">own eyes</b> to Paul, if it were possible. (This might be an indication that Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” was an eye disease.) But where is this sense of gratitude now? Unfortunately, it has vanished like the morning dew.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:16</span> What accounted for their changed attitude toward Paul? He was still preaching the same message, earnestly contending for <b class="calibre5">the truth</b> of the gospel. If this made him their <b class="calibre5">enemy</b>, then their position was dangerous indeed.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-86" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-72">E. Bondage or Freedom (4:17—5:1)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:17</span> The motives of the false teachers differed from Paul’s: they wanted a following, whereas he was interested in the spiritual welfare of the Galatians (4:17–20). The false teachers were zealous in their efforts to win the affections of the Galatians, but their motives were not sincere. <b class="calibre5">They want to exclude you</b>. The Judaizers wanted to cut the Galatians off from the Apostle Paul and from other teachers. They wanted a following, and sought to form a sect in order to get it. Stott warns: “When Christianity is turned into a bondage to rules and regulations, its victims are inevitably in subjection, tied to the apron strings of their teachers, as in the Middle Ages.”<a id="calibre_link-34" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-73">17</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:18</span> Paul says, in effect, “I do not mind others fussing over you, even when I am absent from you, as long as they are doing so with pure motives and for a <b class="calibre5">good</b> cause.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:19</span> By calling the Galatians his <b class="calibre5">little children</b>, Paul would remind them that it was he who had pointed them to Christ. He is undergoing birth-pangs again for them, not this time seeking their salvation, but rather that <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> might be <b class="calibre5">formed in</b> them. Christlikeness is God’s full objective for His people (Eph. 4:13; Col. 1:28).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:20</span> This verse might mean that Paul was puzzled as to the true status of the Galatians. Their defection from the truth had left him with <b class="calibre5">doubts</b>. He would like to be able <b class="calibre5">to change</b> his <b class="calibre5">tone</b> and speak with certainty and conviction about them. Or perhaps he was perplexed as to their reaction to his Letter. He would rather be speaking with them in person. Then he could better express himself by changing the <b class="calibre5">tone</b> of his voice. If they were receptive to his rebukes, he could be tender. If, however, they were haughty and rebellious, he could be stern. As it was, he was perplexed about them; he could not tell what their reaction to his message would be.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Since the Jewish teachers made so much of Abraham and insisted that believers must follow his example by being circumcised, Paul turns to Abraham’s domestic history to show that legalism is slavery and cannot be mixed with grace.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">God had promised that Abraham would have a son, even though he and Sarah were too old, naturally speaking, to have children. Abraham believed God and thus was justified (Gen. 15:1–6). Sometime afterward, Sarah became discouraged, waiting for the promised son, and suggested that Abraham should have a child by her slave-girl, Hagar. Abraham followed her advice, and Ishmael was born. This was not the heir promised by God, but the son of Abraham’s impatience, carnality, and lack of trust (Gen. 16).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then, when Abraham was one hundred years old, the child of promise, Isaac, was born. Obviously this birth was miraculous; it was made possible only by the mighty power of God (Gen. 21:1–5). At the customary feast in observance of the weaning of Isaac, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking her son. She thereupon ordered Abraham to expel Ishmael and his mother from the home, saying, “The son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, namely, with Isaac” (Gen. 21:8–11). This is the background for the argument which the apostle now takes up.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:21</span> <b class="calibre5">Law</b> in this verse is used in two different senses. The first refers to law as a means of attaining holiness, and the second to the OT books of the law (Genesis through Deuteronomy), particularly Genesis. Paul is saying, <b class="calibre5">“Tell me, you who desire to</b> obtain favor with God by law-keeping, <b class="calibre5">do you not</b> listen to the message of the book of <b class="calibre5">the law?”</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:22, 23</span> The <b class="calibre5">two sons</b> were Ishmael and Isaac. The <b class="calibre5">bondwoman</b> was Hagar, and the <b class="calibre5">freewoman</b> was Sarah. Ishmael was born as a result of Abraham’s scheming intervention. Isaac, on the other hand, was given to Abraham by <b class="calibre5">promise</b> of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:24</span> The story is <b class="calibre5">symbolic</b>; it has a deeper meaning than at first appears. The real significance of the events is not expressly stated, but is implied. Thus, the true story of Isaac and Ishmael represents deep spiritual truth, which Paul now proceeds to explain.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The two women represent <b class="calibre5">two covenants: Hagar</b> the covenant of law, and Sarah the covenant of grace. The law was given at <b class="calibre5">Mount Sinai</b>. Strangely enough, the word “Hagar” in the Arabic language means “Rock,” and the Arabs called Mt. Sinai “the Rock.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:25</span> The covenant given at <b class="calibre5">Sinai</b> produced slavery; thus <b class="calibre5">Hagar</b>, a slave-girl, was a fitting type of the law. <b class="calibre5">Hagar</b> represents <b class="calibre5">Jerusalem</b>, the capital of the Jewish nation, and the center for the unsaved Israelites who were still seeking to obtain righteousness by keeping the law. These, together <b class="calibre5">with</b> their <b class="calibre5">children</b>, their followers, are <b class="calibre5">in bondage</b>. For Paul to link unbelieving Israelites with Hagar rather than with Sarah, with Ishmael rather than with Isaac, was a stinging characterization.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:26</span> The capital city of those who are justified by faith is the heavenly <b class="calibre5">Jerusalem</b>. It <b class="calibre5">is the mother of</b> all believers, both Jew and Gentile.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:27</span> This quotation from Isaiah 54:1 is a prediction that the children of the heavenly city will be more numerous than those of earthly Jerusalem. Sarah was the woman who for so long was <b class="calibre5">barren</b>. Hagar was the woman <b class="calibre5">who has a husband</b>. In what way are we to understand the eventual triumph of Sarah, or the heavenly Jerusalem? The answer is that the <b class="calibre5">children</b> of promise include all those, Gentiles as well as Jews, who come to God by faith—<b class="calibre5">many more</b> than the children of Hagar who abide under the law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:28</span> True believers are born not of the will of man nor of the will of the flesh, but of God. It is not natural descent that counts, but divine miraculous birth by faith in the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:29</span> Ishmael mocked Isaac, and it has always been true that those born of the flesh have <b class="calibre5">persecuted</b> those <b class="calibre5">born</b> of <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b>. Consider the sufferings of our Lord and of the Apostle Paul at the hands of unsaved men. It may seem to us a trivial offense that Ishmael should mock Isaac, but Scripture records it, and Paul sees in it a principle that still abides—the enmity between <b class="calibre5">the flesh</b> and <b class="calibre5">the Spirit.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:30</span> Let the Galatians then appeal to <b class="calibre5">Scripture</b>, and they will hear this verdict. Law and grace cannot be mixed; it is impossible to inherit God’s blessings on the basis of human merit or fleshly effort.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:31</span> Those who have trusted Christ have no connection with the law as a means of obtaining divine favor. They are children of the freewoman, and they follow the social condition of their mother.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:1</span> The last verse of chapter 4 describes the believer’s position—he is free. This first verse of chapter 5 refers to his practice—he should live as a <b class="calibre5">free</b> man. Here we have a very good illustration of the difference between law and grace. The law would say: “If you earn your freedom, you will become free.” But grace says: “You have been made free at the tremendous cost of the death of Christ. In gratitude to Him, you should <b class="calibre5">stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made</b> you <b class="calibre5">free</b>.” Law commands but does not enable. Grace provides what law demands, then enables man to live a life consistent with his position by the power of the Holy Spirit and rewards him for doing it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As C. H. Mackintosh says, “The law demands strength from one who has none, and curses him if he cannot display it. The gospel gives strength to one who has none, and blesses him in the exhibition of it.”<a id="calibre_link-35" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-74">18</a></p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">“Run, John, and live,” the law commands,</p>
        <p class="sl">But gives me neither legs nor hands;</p>

        <p class="sl">It bids me fly and gives me wings.</p>

      <h3 id="calibre_link-88" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-3">A. The Peril of Legalism (5:2–15)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">5:2</span> Legalism makes Christ of no value. The Judaizers insisted on the necessity of Gentile believers being <b class="calibre5">circumcised</b> for salvation. Paul, speaking with the authority of an apostle, insists that to depend on circumcision is to make <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> of no benefit. Says Jack Hunter:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">In the Galatian situation, circumcision to Paul was not a surgical operation, nor merely a religious observance. It represented a system of salvation by good works. It declared a gospel of human effort apart from divine grace. It was law supplanting grace; Moses supplanting Christ; for to add to Christ was to take from Christ. Christ supplemented was Christ supplanted; Christ is the only Savior—solitary and exclusive. Circumcision would mean excision from Christ.<a id="calibre_link-36" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-4">19</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:3</span> Legalism requires men <b class="calibre5">to keep the whole law</b>. People under law cannot accept the easy commandments and reject the others. If a person attempts to please God by being circumcised, then he is under obligation <b class="calibre5">to keep the whole law</b>. Thus a man is entirely under law, or not under law at all. Obviously, if he is entirely under law, Christ is valueless to him. The Lord Jesus is not only a <i class="calibre3">complete</i> Savior, but also an <i class="calibre3">exclusive</i> one. Paul is not referring in this verse to any who might have been circumcised in the past, but only to those who might undergo this rite as a necessity for complete justification, to those who assert the obligations of law-keeping for their acceptance with God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:4</span> Legalism means the abandonment of <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> as one’s only hope of righteousness. This verse has given rise to considerable discussion. Many different interpretations have been offered, but these may be grouped broadly in three classes, as follows:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Many hold that Paul here teaches that it is possible for a person to be truly saved, then to fall into sin, and therefore to fall from grace and be forever lost. This has come to be known as “the falling away doctrine.”
          <p class="calibre2">We believe such an interpretation to be unsound for two compelling reasons: First, the verse does not describe saved persons who fall into sin. In fact, there is no mention of falling into sin. Rather, the verse is speaking of those who are living moral, respectable, upright lives and hope to be saved thereby. Thus the passage acts as a boomerang on those who use it to support the falling away doctrine. They teach that a Christian must keep the law, live a perfect life, and otherwise refrain from sinning in order to remain saved. However, this Scripture insists that all who seek to be justified by works of law or self-effort <b class="calibre5">have fallen from grace.</b></p>
          <p class="calibre2">Secondly, this interpretation contradicts the overall, consistent testimony of the NT to the effect that every true believer in the Lord Jesus Christ is eternally saved, that no sheep of Christ will ever perish, and that salvation depends entirely on the finished work of the Savior, and not on man’s feeble efforts (John 3:16, 36; 5:24; 6:47; 10:28).</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. A second interpretation of the verse is that it refers to those who were originally saved by faith in the Lord Jesus, but who subsequently put themselves under the law to retain their salvation or to achieve holiness. In other words, they were saved by grace, but now seek to be kept by law. In this case, to fall from grace is, as Philip Mauro put it, “to turn from God’s way of perfecting His saints by the work of the Spirit in them, and to seek that end through the observance of external rites and ceremonies, which men of the flesh can observe as well as saints of God.”
          <p class="calibre2">This view is unscriptural, first because the verse does not describe Christians who seek holiness or sanctification, but rather unsaved persons who seek <i class="calibre3">justification</i> by law-keeping. Note the wording—<b class="calibre5">you who attempt to be justified by law</b>. And second, this explanation of the verse implies the possibility of saved people being subsequently severed from Christ, and this is inconsistent with right views of the grace of God.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="ul" value="3">3. The third interpretation is that Paul is speaking of people who might profess to be Christians but who are not truly saved. They are seeking to be justified by keeping the law. The apostle is telling them that they cannot have two saviors; they must choose either Christ or the law. If they choose the law, then they are severed from Christ as their only possible hope of righteousness; they <b class="calibre5">have fallen from grace</b>. Hogg and Vine express it clearly:</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Christ must be everything or nothing to a man; no limited trust or divided allegiance is acceptable to Him. The man who is justified by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is a Christian; the man who seeks to be justified by the works of the law is not.<a id="calibre_link-37" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-5">20</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:5</span> The apostle shows that the hope of the true believer is far different from that of the legalist. The Christian waits <b class="calibre5">for the hope of righteousness</b>. He hopes for the time when the Lord will come, when he will receive a glorified body, and when he will sin no more. Notice that it does not say that the Christian hopes for righteousness; he already has a right standing before God through the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). But he waits for the moment when he will be completely righteous in himself. He does not hope to achieve this by anything that he can do, but rather <b class="calibre5">through the Spirit</b> and <b class="calibre5">by faith</b>. The Holy Spirit is going to do it all, and the believer simply looks to God in faith to bring it to pass. The legalist, on the other hand, hopes to earn righteousness by his own works, law-keeping, or religious observances. It is a vain hope, because righteousness cannot be achieved in this way.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice that Paul uses the pronoun <b class="calibre5">we</b> in this verse, referring to true Christians, whereas in verse 4 he uses the pronoun “you” when speaking to those who seek justification by works of law.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:6</span> Legalism <b class="calibre5">avails</b> nothing. As far as a person who is <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b> (that is, a Christian) is concerned, <b class="calibre5">circumcision</b> does not make him any better, and <b class="calibre5">uncircumcision</b> does not make him any worse. What God looks for in the believer is <b class="calibre5">faith working through love. Faith</b> is complete dependence on God. <b class="calibre5">Faith</b> is not idle; it manifests itself in unselfish service to God and man. The motive of all such service is <b class="calibre5">love</b>. Thus <b class="calibre5">faith</b> works <b class="calibre5">through love</b>; it is prompted by <b class="calibre5">love</b>, not by law. This is a truth found many times in the Scriptures—that God is not interested in rituals, but in the reality of a godly life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:7</span> Legalism is disobedience to <b class="calibre5">the truth</b>. The Galatians had made a good start in the Christian life, but someone had <b class="calibre5">hindered</b> them. It was the Judaizers, the legalists, the false apostles. By accepting their erroneous teachings, the saints were disobeying <b class="calibre5">the truth</b> of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:8</span> Legalism is not a divine teaching. <b class="calibre5">Persuasion</b> here means belief or doctrine. <b class="calibre5">Him who calls you</b> refers to God. Thus the belief that circumcision and law-keeping should be added to faith in Christ does not come from God but from the devil.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:9</span> Legalism leads to more and more evil. <b class="calibre5">Leaven</b> in the Scripture is a common symbol of evil. Here it refers to the evil doctrine of the Judaizers. The natural tendency of <b class="calibre5">leaven</b>, or yeast, to affect all the meal with which it comes in contact is used here to show that <b class="calibre5">a little</b> error must inevitably lead to more. Evil is never static. It must defend its lies by adding more lies. Legalism is like garlic; there is no such thing as a little of it. If a few people in a church hold false doctrine, they will get more and more followers, unless sternly dealt with.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:10</span> Legalism brings judgment on its teachers. Paul was confident that the Galatians would reject the false teachings. His <b class="calibre5">confidence</b> was <b class="calibre5">in the Lord</b>, which may mean that the Lord had given assurance to Paul on this matter. Or, knowing the Lord as he did, he was sure that the Great Shepherd would restore His wandering sheep, perhaps even through the Letter which Paul was then writing to them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As for the false teachers themselves, they would be punished by God. It is a serious thing to teach error and thereby to wreck a church (1 Cor. 3:17). It is much worse, for instance, to teach that drunkenness is permissible than to be a drunkard yourself, for the false teacher makes scores of others like himself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:11</span> Legalism does away with <b class="calibre5">the offense of the cross</b>. Paul now answers the absurd charge that even he at times preached the necessity of circumcision. He is still suffering <b class="calibre5">persecution</b> at the hands of the Jews. This <b class="calibre5">persecution</b> would stop instantly if he preached <b class="calibre5">circumcision</b>, because that would mean he had abandoned preaching <b class="calibre5">the cross</b>. The cross is an <b class="calibre5">offense</b> to man. It offends him or stumbles him because it tells him that there is nothing he can do to earn salvation. It gives no place to the flesh and its efforts. It spells an end to human works. If Paul were to introduce works by preaching circumcision, then he would be setting aside the whole meaning of the cross.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:12</span> The apostle’s wish that the troublemakers <b class="calibre5">would … cut themselves off</b> may be understood literally; he wishes that they were castrated. They were zealous in using the knife to circumcise others; now let the knife be used to make them eunuchs. It is probably preferable to take the words figuratively; in other words, Paul wishes that the false teachers were cut off from the Galatians altogether.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The gospel of grace has always been accused of permitting men to live as they like. People say: “If salvation is by faith alone, then there is no control over a person’s conduct afterwards.” But the apostle is quick to point out that Christian liberty does not mean license to sin. The believer’s standard is the life of the Lord Jesus, and love for Christ impels him to hate sin and love holiness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Perhaps it was especially necessary for Paul to warn his readers against license here. When men have been under the restraints of law for some time and are then granted their freedom, there is always the danger of going from the extreme of bondage to that of carelessness. The proper balance is that liberty which lies between law and license. The Christian is free from the law, but not lawless.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:13</span> Christian <b class="calibre5">liberty</b> does not permit sin; it rather encourages loving service. <b class="calibre5">Love</b> is seen as the motive of all Christian behavior, whereas under law, the motive is fear of punishment. Findlay says: “Love’s slaves are the true freemen.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Christian’s freedom is <i class="calibre3">in Christ Jesus</i> (2:4), and this excludes any possible thought that it might ever mean freedom to sin. We must never turn our freedom into a base of operations <b class="calibre5">for the flesh</b>. Just as an invading army will seek to gain a beachhead and use it as a base of operations for further conquest, so the flesh will utilize a little license to expand its territory.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A proper outlet for our freedom is this: “Make it a habit to be slaves one to another.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">A. T. Pierson says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">True freedom is found only in obedience to proper restraint. A river finds liberty to flow, only between banks: without these it would only spread out into a slimy, stagnant pool. Planets, uncontrolled by law, would only bring wreck to themselves and to the universe. The same law which fences us in, fences others out; the restraints which regulate our liberty also insure and protect it. It is not control, but the right kind of control, and a cheerful obedience which make the free man.<a id="calibre_link-38" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-6">21</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:14</span> At first, it seems strange that Paul should introduce the <b class="calibre5">law</b> here after emphasizing all through the Epistle that believers are not under it. He is not urging his readers to go back to the law; he is showing that what the law demanded but could not produce is the very thing that results from the exercise of Christian liberty.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:15</span> Legalism invariably leads to quarreling, and apparently it had done so in Galatia. How strange! Here were people who wanted to be under the law. The law requires them to love their neighbors. Yet the very reverse has happened. They have been backbiting and devouring one another. This behavior springs from the flesh, to which the law gives a place, and on which it acts.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-89" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-7">B. Power for Holiness (5:16–25)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">5:16</span> The believer should <b class="calibre5">walk in the Spirit</b>, not in the flesh. To <b class="calibre5">walk in</b> (or by) <b class="calibre5">the Spirit</b> is to allow Him to have His way. It is to remain in communion with Him. It is to make decisions in the light of His holiness. It is to be occupied with Christ, because the Spirit’s ministry is to engage the believer with the Lord Jesus. When we thus <b class="calibre5">walk in the Spirit, the flesh</b>, or self-life, is treated as dead. We cannot be occupied at the same time with Christ and with sin.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Scofield says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The problem of the Christian life is based on the fact that so long as the Christian lives in this world he is, so to speak, two trees—the old tree of the flesh, and the new tree of the divine nature implanted by the new birth; and the problem itself is, how to keep barren the old tree and to make fruitful the new tree. The problem is solved by walking in the Spirit.<a id="calibre_link-39" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-8">22</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse and those that follow show that <b class="calibre5">the flesh</b> is still present with the Christian; the idea of the eradication of the sinful nature is thus refuted.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:17</span> <b class="calibre5">The Spirit</b> and <b class="calibre5">the flesh</b> are in constant conflict. God could have removed the fleshly nature from believers at the time of their conversion, but He did not choose to do so. Why? He wanted to keep them continually reminded of their own weakness; to keep them continually dependent on Christ, their Priest and Advocate; and to cause them to praise unceasingly the One who saved such worms. Instead of removing the old nature, God gave us His own Holy Spirit to indwell us. God’s Spirit and our flesh are perpetually at war, and will continue to be at war until we are taken home to heaven. The believer’s part in the conflict is to yield to the Spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:18</span> Those who are Spirit-led <b class="calibre5">are not under the law</b>. This verse might be understood in two ways: <b class="calibre5">Led by the Spirit</b> is a description of all Christians. Therefore, no Christians are <b class="calibre5">under the law</b>; they are not depending on self-effort. It is the <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> who is resisting the motions of evil within them, not they themselves. Also, to be <b class="calibre5">led by the Spirit</b> means to be lifted above the flesh and to be occupied with the Lord. When one is so occupied, he is not thinking of the law or the flesh. The Spirit of God does not lead people to look to the law as a means of justification. Rather, He points them to the risen Christ as the only ground of acceptance before God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:19–21</span> We have mentioned before that the law appeals to the energy of the flesh. What kind of <b class="calibre5">works</b> does fallen human nature produce? There is no difficulty in identifying <b class="calibre5">the works of the flesh</b>. They are <b class="calibre5">evident</b> to all. <b class="calibre5">Adultery</b><a id="calibre_link-40" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-9">23</a> is unfaithfulness in the marriage relationship. <b class="calibre5">Fornication</b> is unlawful sexual intercourse. <b class="calibre5">Uncleanness</b> is moral evil, sensuality. <b class="calibre5">Lewdness</b> is shameless conduct involving absence of restraint. <b class="calibre5">Idolatry</b> is not only the worship of idols, but also the immorality that accompanies demon worship. <b class="calibre5">Sorcery</b> is witchcraft, the Greek word being related to drugs (<i class="calibre3">pharmakeia</i>). Because drugs were used in sorcery, the word came to mean intercourse with evil spirits, or the use of magic spells. It may also include superstitions, “bad luck,” and so on. <b class="calibre5">Hatred</b> means strong feelings of malice directed toward individuals. <b class="calibre5">Contentions</b> are discord, variance, quarrels. <b class="calibre5">Jealousies</b> are distrust, suspicions. <b class="calibre5">Wrath</b> is <b class="calibre5">outbursts</b> of hot anger or passions. <b class="calibre5">Selfish ambitions</b> are self-centered strivings to be “number one,” even at others’ expense. <b class="calibre5">Dissensions</b> are separations caused by disagreements. <b class="calibre5">Heresies</b> are sects formed by men with self-willed opinions. <b class="calibre5">Envy</b> is displeasure at the success or prosperity of others. <b class="calibre5">Murders</b><a id="calibre_link-41" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-10">24</a> are unlawful killing of others. <b class="calibre5">Drunkenness</b> refers to intoxication caused by strong drink. <b class="calibre5">Revelries</b> are riotous gatherings for entertainment, accompanied by drunkenness.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul warns his readers, as he had told them before, <b class="calibre5">that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God</b>. The passage does not teach that a drunkard cannot be saved, but it does say that those whose lives are <i class="calibre3">characterized</i> by the above catalog of fleshly works are not saved.<a id="calibre_link-42" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-11">25</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Why should Paul write in this manner to churches of Christians? The reason is that not all who profess to be saved are true children of God. Thus throughout the NT the Holy Spirit often follows the presentation of wonderful spiritual truths with the most solemn warnings to all who profess the name of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:22, 23</span> It is significant that the apostle distinguishes between the <i class="calibre3">works</i> of the flesh, and the <b class="calibre5">fruit of the Spirit</b>. Works are produced by human energy. <b class="calibre5">Fruit</b> is grown as a branch abides in the vine (John 15:5). They differ as a factory and a garden differ. Note that <b class="calibre5">fruit</b> is singular, not plural. The Holy Spirit produces one kind of <b class="calibre5">fruit</b>, that is, Christlikeness. All the virtues now listed describe the life of the child of God. Dr. C. I. Scofield has pointed out that every one of them is foreign to the soil of the human heart.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Love</b> is what God is, and what we ought to be. It is beautifully described in 1 Corinthians 13, and told out in all its fullness at the cross of Calvary. <b class="calibre5">Joy</b> is contentment and satisfaction with God and with His dealings. Christ displayed it in John 4:34. <b class="calibre5">Peace</b> could include the peace of God as well as harmonious relations among Christians. For peace in the life of the Redeemer, see Luke 8:22–25. <b class="calibre5">Longsuffering</b> is patience in afflictions, annoyances, and persecutions. Its supreme example is found in Luke 23:34. <b class="calibre5">Kindness</b> is gentleness, perhaps best explained in the attitude of the Lord toward little children (Mark 10:14). <b class="calibre5">Goodness</b> is kindness shown to others. To see goodness in action, we have but to read Luke 10:30–35. <b class="calibre5">Faithfulness</b> may mean trust in God, confidence in our fellow Christians, fidelity, or reliability. This latter is probably the meaning here. <b class="calibre5">Gentleness</b> is taking the lowly place as Jesus did when He washed His disciples’ feet (John 13:1–17). <b class="calibre5">Self-control</b> means literally holding oneself in, especially regarding sex. Our lives should be disciplined. Lust, passions, appetites, and temper should be ruled. We should practice moderation. As Samuel Chadwick points out:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">In newspaper English the passage reads something like this: the fruit of the Spirit is an affectionate, lovable disposition; a radiant spirit and a cheerful temper; a tranquil mind and a quiet manner; a forbearing patience in provoking circumstances and with trying people; a sympathetic insight and tactful helpfulness; generous judgment and a big-souled charity; loyalty and reliableness under all circumstances; humility that forgets self in the joy of others; in all things self-mastered and self-controlled, which is the final mark of perfection. How striking this is in relation to 1 Cor. 13!<a id="calibre_link-43" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-12">26</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul closes this list with the cryptic comment: <b class="calibre5">“Against such there is no law.”</b> Of course not! These virtues are pleasing to God, beneficial to others, and good for ourselves. But how is this fruit produced? Is it by man’s effort? Not at all. It is produced as Christians live in communion with the Lord. As they gaze upon the Savior in loving devotion, and obey Him in daily life, the Holy Spirit works a wonderful miracle. He transforms them into the likeness of Christ. They become like Him by beholding Him (2 Cor. 3:18). Just as the branch derives all its life and nourishment from the vine, so the believer in Christ derives his strength from the True Vine, and is thus able to live a fruitful life for God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:24</span> <b class="calibre5">Those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh.</b> The verb tense<a id="calibre_link-44" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-13">27</a> here indicates something that happened decisively in the past. It actually occurred at the time of our conversion. When we repented, there was a sense in which we nailed the old, evil, corrupt nature to the cross with all its affections and lusts. We determined that we would no longer live to cater to our fallen nature, that it would no longer dominate it. Of course, this decision has to be renewed continually in our lives. We must constantly keep the flesh in the place of death.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">5:25</span> <b class="calibre5">If</b> here carries the thought of “since.” Since we have eternal life by the work of <b class="calibre5">the</b> Holy <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> in us, let us live out the new life by the power of <b class="calibre5">the</b> same <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b>. The law never could give life, and was never intended to be the Christian’s rule of life.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-90" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-14">C. Practical Exhortations (5:26—6:10)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">5:26</span> In this verse there are three attitudes to be avoided:</p>
      <ol class="calibre4">
        <li class="ulf" value="1">1. Conceit—<b class="calibre5">Let us not become conceited</b>, literally holding of false or empty opinion (of ourselves). God does not want Christians to be boastful or conceited braggarts; it does not fit in with being a sinner saved by grace. Men living under law often become proud of their miserable achievements, and taunt those who do not come up to their standards, and legalistic Christians will often run down other Christians who don’t have the same lists of borderline things that they condemn.</li>
        <li class="ul" value="2">2. Provocation—<b class="calibre5">Provoking one another</b>. It is a denial of the Spirit-filled life to provoke or challenge other people to measure up to one’s own private viewpoints. One never knows the problems and temptations of another person’s heart, never having walked in his shoes.</li>
        <li class="ull" value="3">3. Envy—<b class="calibre5">Envying one another</b>. Envy is specifically the sin of wanting something that belongs to someone else to which one has no right or claim. Envy begrudges another person’s superior success, talents, possessions, or good looks. Persons of few talents or weak character are apt to envy those who seem to be more successful law-keepers. All such attributes are foreign to grace. A true believer should esteem others better than himself. Law-keepers desire false glory. True greatness is to serve unnoticed, to labor unseen.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:1</span> Here is a lovely statement on how a sinning believer is to be treated by other Christians. It is in sharp contrast to the law, of course, which called down judgment on offenders. To be <b class="calibre5">overtaken in any trespass</b> describes a man who has committed an act of sin rather than one who is habitually sinful. Such a person is to be dealt with by <b class="calibre5">spiritual</b> Christians. A carnal Christian might, by a hard, cold attitude, do more harm than good. Then, too, the offender will not be likely to receive the admonition of one who is himself out of touch with the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse raises an interesting question. If a man is truly spiritual, would he admit it? Are not spiritual people most conscious of their shortcomings? Who then would do the work of restoration, if doing so marked him as a spiritual man? Would it not betray a lack of modesty? The answer is this: A truly spiritual man will never boast of his condition, but he will have the tender heart of a shepherd, making him want to restore the transgressor. He will not act in a spirit of pride or superiority, but <b class="calibre5">in a spirit of gentleness</b>, remembering that he <b class="calibre5">also</b> might <b class="calibre5">be tempted.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:2</span> <b class="calibre5">Burdens</b> refers to failures, temptations, testings, and trials. Instead of standing off at a distance and criticizing, we should fly to the side of a brother in trouble or distress and help him in every possible way.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The law of Christ</b> includes all the commandments of the Lord Jesus for His people found in the NT. It may be summarized by the commandment, “that you love one another” (John 13:34; 15:12). We fulfill this when we <b class="calibre5">bear one another’s burdens</b>. <b class="calibre5">The law of Christ</b> is far different from that of Moses. Moses’ Law promised life for obedience, but gave no power to obey, and could only encourage obedience by the fear of punishment. <b class="calibre5">The law of Christ</b>, on the other hand, is loving instruction for those who already have life. Believers are enabled to keep its precepts by the power of the Holy Spirit, and their motivation is love to Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:3</span> We are all made out of the same dust. When we see a brother sin, we should remember that it might have been ourselves. For a Christian to have a superiority complex is a form of self-deception. Certainly we should never think that bearing others’ burdens is beneath our dignity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:4</span> This seems to be a warning against the habit of comparing ourselves with others, and finding cause for satisfaction. The apostle points out that we will be examined individually and not in comparison with others at the Judgment Seat of Christ. Therefore, we should take heed to ourselves, so that we might be able to rejoice in <i class="calibre3">our</i> <b class="calibre5">work</b> rather than in <i class="calibre3">others</i>’ failures.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:5</span> In verse 2, Paul teaches that we should share one another’s sorrows, sufferings, and problems in this present life. In verse 5, the thought is that every one of us will have to <b class="calibre5">bear his own load</b> of responsibility at the Judgment Seat of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:6</span> Believers are responsible to support their Christian teachers. To <b class="calibre5">share in all good things</b> means <b class="calibre5">to share</b> with them the material <b class="calibre5">things</b> of life, and also to sustain them with prayer and godly interest.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:7</span> Although others may not notice our neglect of God’s servants, He sees it, and gives a harvest accordingly. We <b class="calibre5">reap</b> what we sow, and we reap in greater quantities than we sow. When the farmer <b class="calibre5">sows</b> wheat, he reaps wheat, sometimes thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold. Scofield remarks that “the Spirit is not speaking here to sinners about their sins, but to saints about their meanness.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Of course, it is true in a wider sense that “those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same” (Job 4:8) and that those who “sow the wind … reap the whirlwind” (Hos. 8:7). J. A. Froude, the historian, said, “One lesson, and only one, history may be said to repeat with distinctness, that the world is built somehow on moral foundations, that in the long run, it is well with the good, and in the long run it is ill with the wicked.”<a id="calibre_link-45" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-15">28</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:8</span> Although it is true in a general sense that we reap whatever we sow, it should be noticed that this reminder follows an exhortation on Christian giving. Viewed in that light, we see that sowing <b class="calibre5">to the flesh</b> means spending one’s money on oneself, one’s own pleasures and comforts. Sowing <b class="calibre5">to the Spirit</b> is using one’s money for the furtherance of God’s interests.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Those who do the former reap a harvest of disappointment and loss right here on earth because they learn as they grow older that the flesh they lived to please is decaying and dying. Then in the age to come they lose eternal rewards. Those who sow <b class="calibre5">to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life</b>. There are two ways in which eternal life (same word translated <b class="calibre5">everlasting</b>) is used in the Bible: (1) It is the present possession of every believer (John 3:36). (2) It is that which the believer receives at the end of his life here on earth (Rom. 6:22). Those <b class="calibre5">who sow to the Spirit</b> enjoy eternal life here and now in a way which other Christians do not. Then, too, they will reap the rewards which accompany faithfulness when they reach their heavenly home.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:9</span> Lest any should become discouraged, Paul reminds his readers that the rewards are certain, even if not immediate. You do not harvest a field of wheat the day after you sow the seed. So in the spiritual realm, the rewards surely follow faithful sowing <b class="calibre5">in due season</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:10</span> <b class="calibre5">The household of faith</b> includes all who are saved, without regard to denominations or divisions. Our kindness is not to be limited to believers, but is to be shown to them in a special way. It is not negative (how little harm), but positive (how much good we can do) that is to be our objective. John Wesley said it so succinctly: “Do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.”</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-91" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-16">D. Conclusion (6:11–18)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">6:11</span> <b class="calibre5">See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!</b> Instead of dictating it to an assistant, as he usually did, Paul had written the letter himself. The <b class="calibre5">large letters</b> with which he wrote might have indicated his deep feeling in seeking to combat the legalists and how serious he considered the Judaizing error to be, or that Paul’s eyesight was poor, as many have suggested from this and other passages. We feel that the latter view is correct.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:12</span> The Judaizers wanted to make a <b class="calibre5">good showing in the flesh</b> by building up a large group of followers. They could do this by insisting on circumcision. People are often quite willing to observe rites and ceremonies as long as they are not required to change their habits. It is common today to build up a large church membership by lowering the standards. Paul sees through the insincerity of these false teachers and accuses them of seeking to avoid <b class="calibre5">persecution for the cross of Christ</b>. The cross signifies the condemnation of the flesh and its efforts to please God. The cross spells death for the fleshly nature and its noblest efforts. The cross means separation from evil. Therefore, men hate the glorious message of the cross, and persecute those who preach it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:13</span> The legalists were not really interested in keeping <b class="calibre5">the law</b>. What they wanted was an easy way to obtain converts, so that they could <b class="calibre5">boast</b> of a long list of followers. Boice says: “It was an attempt to win others to that which was itself bankrupt; for not even those who were circumcised were able to keep the law.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:14</span> Paul’s ground for boasting is not in the flesh of men, but <b class="calibre5">in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. On that <b class="calibre5">cross</b> the world died to Paul and Paul to the world. When a man is saved, the world says good-bye to him, and he says good-bye <b class="calibre5">to the world</b>. He is spoiled as far as <b class="calibre5">the world</b> is concerned because he is no longer interested in its fleeting pleasures; <b class="calibre5">the world</b> has lost its attraction for him, because he has found One who completely satisfies. Findlay says: “He can never believe in it, never take pride in it, nor do homage to it any more. It is stripped of its glory and robbed of its power to charm or govern him.” Thus <b class="calibre5">the cross</b> is a great barrier or dividing line between the world and the child of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:15</span> Although at first sight it might not seem so, this verse is one of the most important statements of Christian truth in the entire Epistle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Circumcision</b> was an external observance, a ritual. The Jewish teachers made everything depend on the observance of this ceremony. <b class="calibre5">Circumcision</b> was the foundation of Judaism. Paul sweeps it aside with a flourish—“<b class="calibre5">circumcision</b> is nothing.” Neither ritual nor Judaism nor legalism counts. Then Paul adds—<b class="calibre5">nor uncircumcision</b>. There are those who pride themselves on their absence of ritual. Their whole church service is a revolt against ceremony. This is of no value either.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What really counts with God is <b class="calibre5">a new creation</b>. He wants to see the transformed life. Findlay writes: “The true Christianity is that which turns bad men into good, which transforms the slaves of sin into sons of God.” All men are in one of two creations. As born into the world, they are sinful, helpless, and condemned. All their efforts to save themselves, or to assist God in their salvation by good character or good works, are futile, and leave them unchanged. The <b class="calibre5">new creation</b> is headed by the risen Christ, and includes all who have been redeemed from sin and given new life in Him. Because the <b class="calibre5">new creation</b> is all of Christ from start to finish, it excludes any thought of gaining God’s favor through character or works. A life of holiness is produced, not by the observance of ritual, but by yielding to Christ and permitting Him to live His life in the believer. The <b class="calibre5">new creation</b> is not an improvement of or addition to the old, but something entirely different.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:16</span> Of what <b class="calibre5">rule</b> is Paul speaking here? It is the <b class="calibre5">rule</b> of the new creation. He pronounces the double blessing of <b class="calibre5">peace and mercy</b> on all those who judge teaching by the question—“Is it of the new creation?”—and who reject all that is not.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And upon the Israel of God.</b> Many have taken this to mean the church. However, <b class="calibre5">the Israel of God</b> refers to those Jews by natural birth who accept the Lord Jesus as Messiah. There was neither peace nor mercy for those who walked under the law, but both are the portion of those in the new creation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:17</span> Paul, once the slave of the law, had been delivered from that bondage by the Lord Jesus. Now he belonged to the Lord as a willing slave. Just as slaves were branded with the mark of their master, so Paul had the ownership <b class="calibre5">marks of the Lord Jesus</b> on his <b class="calibre5">body</b>. What were they? They were the scars which he received at the hands of his persecutors. Now he says: “Don’t let anyone try to reclaim me. Don’t talk to me about the brand-mark of circumcision, indicating bondage to the law. I wear the brand of my new Master, Jesus Christ.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">6:18</span> The apostle is now about to lay down his pen. But he must close with an added word. What will it be? <b class="calibre5">GRACE</b>—the word which so characterizes his gospel. <b class="calibre5">Grace</b>, not law. It was the theme on which he began (1:3); it is the theme with which he closes. <b class="calibre5">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</b></p>

        <p class="sbt"><a class="xref" href="part0002.html#rsb33">LEGALISM</a></p>
        <p class="sbaft">On completing a study of Galatians, one might conclude that Paul defeated the teachers of legalism so effectively that the issue would never trouble the church again. History and experience prove otherwise! Legalism has become so important a part of Christendom that most people believe that it actually belongs.</p>
        <p class="sb">Yes, the legalists are still with us. What else shall we call those professed ministers of Christ who teach, for instance, that confirmation, baptism, or church membership are necessary for salvation; that the law is the believer’s rule of life; that we are saved by faith but kept by works? What is it but Judaism brought over into Christianity when we are asked to accept a humanly ordained priesthood with its distinctive clothing, buildings patterned after the temple with their carved altars and elaborate rituals, and a church calendar with its Lenten season, its feasts, and its fasts?</p>
        <p class="sb">And what is it but the Galatian heresy when believers are warned that they must keep the Sabbath if they are to be saved at last? Modern preachers of legalism are making tremendous inroads among those who profess faith in Christ, and for this reason every believer should be warned of their teaching and instructed how to answer them.</p>
        <p class="sb">The prophets of the Sabbath usually begin by preaching the gospel of salvation by faith in Christ. They use beloved evangelical hymns to lure the unwary, and appear to place much emphasis on the Scriptures. But before long, they put their followers under the Law of Moses, especially the commandment concerning the Sabbath. (The Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, or Saturday.)</p>
        <p class="sb">How do they dare to do this in the light of Paul’s clear teaching that the Christian is dead to the law? How do they get around the plain statements of Galatians? The answer is that they make a sharp distinction between the moral law and the ceremonial law. The moral law is the Ten Commandments. The ceremonial law covers the other regulations given by God, such as rules concerning unclean foods, leprosy, offerings to God, and so forth.</p>
        <p class="sb">The moral law, they say, has never been revoked. It is an expression of God’s eternal truth. To commit idolatry, murder, or adultery will always be contrary to God’s law. The ceremonial law, however, has been done away in Christ. Therefore, they conclude, when Paul teaches that the Christian is dead to the law, he is speaking about the ceremonial law and not the Ten Commandments.</p>
        <p class="sb">Since the moral law is still in effect, Christians are bound to keep it, they insist. This means that they must keep the Sabbath, that they must do no work on that day. They assert that one of the popes of the Roman Catholic Church ordered the change from Sabbath-observance to observance of Sunday, in utter violation of Scriptures.</p>
        <p class="sb">This reasoning sounds very logical and appealing. However, its great condemning feature is that it is entirely contrary to God’s word! Note the following points:</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. In 2 Corinthians 3:7–11, the Ten Commandments are definitely stated to be “done away” for the believer in Christ. In verse 7, the law is described as “the ministry of death, written and engraved on stones.” This could only mean the moral law, not the ceremonial law. Only the Ten Commandments were engraved in stones by the finger of God (Ex. 31:18). In verse 11, we read that the ministry of death, though glorious, is <i class="calibre3">done away</i>. Nothing could be more decisive than this. The Sabbath has no claim on the Christian.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. No Gentile was ever commanded to keep the Sabbath. The law was given to the Jewish nation only (Ex. 31:13). Although God Himself rested on the seventh day, He did not command anyone else to do so until He gave the law to the children of Israel.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="3">3. Christians did not switch from the Sabbath to the first day of the week because of the decree of any pope. We set aside the Lord’s Day in a special way for worship and for service because the Lord Jesus rose from the dead on that day, a proof that the work of redemption was completed (John 20:1). Also, on that day the early disciples met to break bread, showing forth the Lord’s death (Acts 20:7), and it was the day appointed by God for the Christians to set apart their offerings as the Lord had prospered them (1 Cor. 16:1, 2). Furthermore, the Holy Spirit was sent down from heaven on the first day of the week.
            <p class="bqnlp">Christians do not “observe” the Lord’s Day as a means of achieving holiness, or from fear of punishment; they set it apart because of loving devotion to the One who gave Himself for them.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="4">4. Paul does not distinguish between the moral law and the ceremonial law. Rather, he insists that the law is a complete unit, and that a curse rests on those who seek to attain righteousness by it, yet fail to keep it all.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="5">5. Nine of the Ten Commandments are repeated in the NT as moral instruction for the children of God. They deal with things that are inherently right or wrong. The one commandment which is omitted is the law of the Sabbath. The keeping of a day is not inherently right or wrong. There is no instruction to Christians to keep the Sabbath. Rather the Scripture distinctly states that the Christian <i class="calibre3">cannot be condemned</i> for failing to keep it (Col. 2:16)!</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="6">6. The penalty for breaking the Sabbath in the OT was death (Ex. 35:2). But those who insist on believers keeping the Sabbath today do not carry out the penalty on offenders. They thus dishonor the law and destroy its authority by failing to insist that its demands be met. They are saying, in effect, “This is God’s law and you must keep it, but nothing will happen if you break it.”</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="7">7. Christ, and not the law, is the believer’s rule of life. We should walk as He walked. This is an even higher standard than was set by the law (Matt. 5:17–48). We are empowered to live holy lives by the Holy Spirit. We want to live holy lives because of our love for Christ. The righteousness demanded by the law is fulfilled by those who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit (Rom. 8:4).</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="sb">Thus, the teaching that believers must keep the Sabbath is directly contrary to Scripture (Col. 2:16), and is simply a “different gospel” upon which God’s word pronounces a curse (Gal. 1:7, 9).</p>
        <p class="sb">May each one be given wisdom from God to discern the evil doctrine of legalism in whatever form it may appear! May we never seek justification or sanctification through ceremonies or human effort, but depend completely and only on the Lord Jesus Christ for every need. May we always remember that legalism is an insult to God because it substitutes the shadow for the Reality—ceremonialism for Christ.</p>

          <p class="sl"><a id="calibre_link-52" class="ennum" href="#calibre_link-20">4.</a> (2:3) Circumcision is a minor surgical operation performed on the male. When God ordained it for Abraham and his descendants, He intended it as a sign of His covenant with them, namely, that He would be their God and they would be His people (Gen. 17:1–11). It was not only a physical mark, but also a spiritual symbol. Abraham was circumcised as a sign that he had trusted in God (Rom. 4:11). The Jews soon forgot the <i class="calibre3">spiritual</i> meaning of circumcision, and carried it out simply as a ceremony. Thus the rite became valueless as far as God was concerned.</p>
          <p class="sb">In the NT, circumcision is no longer commanded since God is now dealing in grace with Gentiles and Jews alike. In the early days of the church, a group of Jewish believers insisted that circumcision was necessary for salvation. Hence this party was known as “the circumcision” (Gal. 2:12).</p>

          <p class="sl"><a id="calibre_link-66" class="ennum" href="#calibre_link-29">12.</a> (3:20) Though there seems to be a contradiction between the argument here and the fact that Christ is later spoken of as the Mediator of the New Covenant (Heb. 9:15), the word <i class="calibre3">mediator</i> is used in two different senses in these two places. Moses served as a mediator simply by receiving the law from God and delivering it to the people of Israel. He was the go-between, or the people’s representative. Christ is Mediator of the New Covenant in a far higher sense. Before God could righteously dispense the blessings of this covenant, the Lord Jesus had to die. Just as death alone puts a person’s last will and testament into force, so the New Covenant had to be sealed with His blood. He had to give Himself a ransom for all (1 Tim. 2:6). Christ not only insures the blessings of the covenant for His people, but also maintains His covenant people in a world that is antagonistic toward them. This He does as High Priest and Advocate, and this is also a part of His mediatorial work.</p>

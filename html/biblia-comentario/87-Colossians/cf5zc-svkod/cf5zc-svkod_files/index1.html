<h2 id="calibre_link-82" class="ahaft">I. Unique Place in the Canon</h2>
      <p class="pf">Most of Paul’s Letters were written to congregations in large or important cities: Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Philippi. Colosse was a town that had seen better days. Even the assembly there did not become well-known in early church history. In short, were it not for this inspired Epistle to the Christians there, Colosse would today be a name known only to students of ancient history.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Although the place was insignificant, the Letter that the apostle sent there is very important. Along with John 1 and Hebrews 1, Colossians 1 presents the most marvelous exposition of the absolute deity of our Lord Jesus Christ. Since this doctrine is fundamental to all Christian truth, its value cannot be over stressed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Letter also has rich instruction on relationships, cultic religion, and the Christian life.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-84" class="ah">II. Authorship</h2>
      <p class="paft">There is no proof that anyone questioned the Pauline authorship of Colossians until the nineteenth century, so complete is the positive evidence. The <i class="calibre3">external evidence</i> is especially strong. Those who quote the Letter, often naming Paul as the author, include Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Theophilus of Antioch, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Origen. Both the Canons of Marcion and Muratori accept Colossians as authentic.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <i class="calibre3">internal evidence</i> includes the simple fact that thrice the writer <i class="calibre3">says</i> he is Paul (1:1, 23; 4:18), and the contents agree with those statements. The exposition of doctrine followed by duty is typical of the apostle. Perhaps the most persuasive proof of authenticity is the strong link with Philemon, which everyone accepts as Pauline. Five of the same men mentioned in that little Letter also show up in Colossians. Even such a critic as Renan was impressed with the Philemon parallels, and <i class="calibre3">he had doubts about Colossians</i>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The arguments <i class="calibre3">against</i> Pauline authorship center on vocabulary, the doctrine of Christ, and apparent references to Gnosticism. Regarding the first point, new vocabulary in Colossians replaces some of Paul’s favorite words. Salmon, a conservative British scholar of the past century, rather wittily counters the argument: “I cannot subscribe to the doctrine that a man writing a new composition must not, on pain of losing his identity, employ any word that he has not used in a former one.”<a id="calibre_link-19" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-2">1</a> Regarding the Christology of Colossians, it dovetails with that of Philippians and John, and only those who desire to transform the deity of Christ into a second-century development from paganism should have any trouble with this doctrine.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As to Gnosticism, the liberal Scottish scholar Moffatt thought that the early stage of Gnosticism presented in Colossians could well have existed in the first century.<a id="calibre_link-20" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-3">2</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus the Pauline authorship of Colossians rests on a firm foundation.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-86" class="ah">III. Date</h2>
      <p class="paft">As one of the “Prison Epistles,” Colossians could conceivably come from Paul’s two-year incarceration in Caesarea (Acts 23:23; 24:27). However, since the evangelist Philip was his host there, it seems unlikely that the apostle would neglect to mention him, Paul being such a courteous and gracious Christian. A possible Ephesian imprisonment has also been suggested, though this is much less likely. The favored time for this Letter and Philemon is in the middle of Paul’s first Roman imprisonment, about <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 60 (Acts 28:30, 31).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Fortunately, as is usually true, an understanding of this book does not depend on a full knowledge of the circumstances under which it was written.</p>

<section id="calibre_link-87" type="chapter">
<h2 id="calibre_link-88" class="ah">IV. Background and Theme</h2>
      <p class="paft">Colosse was a city in the province of Phrygia, in the area now known as Asia Minor. It was located ten miles east of Laodicea and thirteen miles southeast of Hierapolis (see 4:13). It was also located about one hundred miles east of Ephesus, at the mouth of a pass in the Cadmian mountain range (a narrow glen twelve miles long) on the military route from the Euphrates to the West. Colosse was on the Lycus (Wolf) River, which flows westward into the Maeander River shortly after it passes Laodicea. There the water from the hot springs of Hierapolis joins the cold waters from Colosse, producing a “lukewarm” condition at Laodicea. Hierapolis was both a health center and a religious center, while Laodicea was the metropolis of the valley. Colosse had been larger previous to NT times. The name is thought possibly to relate to the word “colossus,” from the fantastic shapes of its limestone formations.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We do not know exactly how the gospel first reached Colosse. At the time Paul wrote this Letter, he had never met the believers there (2:1). It is generally believed that Epaphras was the one who first brought the good news of salvation to this city (1:7). Many believe that he was converted through Paul when the apostle spent the three years at Ephesus. Phrygia is a part of Proconsular Asia, and Paul was in Phrygia (Acts 16:6; 18:23), but not Colosse (2:1).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">We do know from the Letter that a false teaching which in its full-blown form became known as Gnosticism was beginning to threaten the church at Colosse. The Gnostics prided themselves on their knowledge (Gk. <span class="calibre3">gnōsis</span>). They claimed to have information superior to that of the apostles and tried to create the impression that a person could not be truly happy unless he had been initiated into the deepest secrets of their cult.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Some of the Gnostics denied the true humanity of Christ. They taught that “the Christ” was a divine <i class="calibre3">influence</i> that came out from God and rested on the Man, Jesus, at His baptism. They further taught that the Christ left Jesus just before His crucifixion. The result, according to them, was that Jesus died, but the Christ did not.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Certain branches of Gnosticism taught that between God and matter there are various levels or grades of spirit beings. They adopted this view in an effort to explain the origin of evil. A. T. Robertson explains:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The Gnostic speculation concerned itself primarily with the origin of the universe and the existence of evil. They assumed that God is good and yet there is evil in existence. Their theory was that evil is inherent in matter. And yet the good God could not create evil matter. So they postulated a series of emanations, aeons, spirits, angels that came in between God and matter. The idea was that one aeon came from God, another aeon from this aeon, and so on till there was one far enough away from God for God not to be contaminated by the creation of evil matter and yet close enough to have power to do the work.<a id="calibre_link-21" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-44">3</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Some Gnostics, believing that the body was inherently sinful, practiced asceticism, a system of self-denial or even self-torture, in an effort to attain a higher spiritual state. Others went to the opposite extreme, living in carnal indulgence, saying that the body didn’t matter or have any affect on a person’s spiritual life!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It seems that traces of two other errors were found in Colosse. These were antinomianism and Judaism. Antinomianism is the teaching that under grace a person does not need to practice self-control but may give full vent to his bodily appetites and passions. Old Testament Judaism had degenerated into a system of ceremonial observances by which a man hoped to achieve righteousness before God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The errors which existed in Colosse are still with us today. Gnosticism has reappeared in Christian Science, Theosophy, Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Unity, and other systems. Antinomianism is characteristic of all who say that because we are under grace, we can live as we please. Judaism was originally a God-given revelation, whose forms and ceremonies were intended to teach spiritual truths in a typical way, as the Epistle to the Hebrews and other parts of the NT show. This lapsed into a system in which the forms themselves were considered to be meritorious, and so the spiritual meaning was often largely ignored. It has its counterpart today in the many religious systems which teach that a person can gain merit and favor with God by his own works, ignoring or denying his sinful state and need of salvation from God alone.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In Colossians, the Apostle Paul masterfully counteracts all these errors by displaying the glories of the Person and work of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This Epistle bears a striking resemblance to Paul’s Letter to the Ephesians. However, it is a resemblance without repetition. Ephesians views believers as seated with Christ in heavenly places. Colossians, on the other hand, sees believers on earth, with Christ their glorified Head in heaven. The emphasis in <i class="calibre3">Ephesians</i> is that the <i class="calibre3">believer</i> is <i class="calibre3">in Christ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Colossians</i> speaks of <i class="calibre3">Christ in the believer</i>, the hope of glory. In Ephesians, the thrust is on the church as the “Body” of Christ, “the fullness of Him who fills all in all” (Eph. 1:23). Hence the unity of the Body of Christ is stressed. In Colossians, the headship of Christ is set forth extensively in chapter 1, with the necessity of our “holding fast to the Head” (2:18, 19), being submissive to Him. Fifty-four of the 155 verses in Ephesians are similar to verses found in Colossians.</p>

<h2 id="calibre_link-45" class="ahaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-58">I. THE DOCTRINE OF THE PRE-EMINENCE OF CHRIST (Chaps. 1, 2)</a></h2>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-46" class="bhaft"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-59">A. Salutation (1:1, 2)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:1</span> In the days when the NT was written, it was customary to begin a letter with the name of the writer. Thus <b class="calibre5">Paul</b> introduces himself as <b class="calibre5">an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God. An apostle</b> was one who had been especially sent forth by the Lord Jesus as a messenger. In order to confirm the message that they preached, apostles were given the power to perform miracles (2 Cor. 12:12). In addition, we read that when the apostles laid their hands on believers in certain cases, the Holy Spirit was given (Acts 8:15–20; 19:6). There are no apostles in the world today in the strict sense of the word, and it is folly for men to claim to be successors of the original twelve. Ephesians 2:20 is taken by many to indicate that the work of those with the distinctive gift of apostles and prophets had to do chiefly with the founding of the church, in contrast with the work of evangelists, pastors, and teachers (Eph. 4:11), which continue throughout this dispensation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul traces his apostleship to <b class="calibre5">the will of God</b> (see also Acts 9:15; Gal. 1:1). It was not an occupation which he had chosen for himself or for which he had been trained by men. Neither was the office given to him by human ordination. It was not “from men” (as the source), neither “through men” (as the instrument). Rather, his entire ministry was carried out under the solemn realization that God Himself had chosen him to be an apostle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Our brother, Timothy,</b> was with Paul at the time this letter was written. It is good to notice here a complete lack of officialism in Paul’s attitude toward Timothy. Both were members of a common brotherhood and there was no thought of a hierarchy of church dignitaries with pompous titles and distinguishing clothing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:2</span> The Letter is addressed to <b class="calibre5">the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are in Colosse</b>. Here are two of the lovely names that are given in the NT to all Christians. <b class="calibre5">Saints</b> means that they are separated to God from the world and that as a result they should lead holy lives. <b class="calibre5">Faithful brethren</b> indicates that they are children of a common Father through faith in the Lord Jesus; they are believing brothers and sisters. Christians are also called disciples and believers in other sections of the NT.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">In Christ</b> speaks of their <i class="calibre3">spiritual</i> position. When they were saved, God placed them in Christ, “accepted in the beloved.” Henceforth, they had His life and nature. Henceforth, they would no longer be seen by God as children of Adam or as unregenerate men, but He would now see them in all the acceptability of His own Son. The expression <b class="calibre5">in Christ</b> conveys more of intimacy, acceptance, and security than any human mind can understand. The <i class="calibre3">geographical</i> location of these believers is indicated by the expression <b class="calibre5">who are in Colosse</b>. It is doubtful that we would ever have heard of this town had it not been that the gospel was preached there and souls were saved.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul now greets the saints with the lovely salutation: <b class="calibre5">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</b> No two words could better embrace the blessings of Christianity than <b class="calibre5">grace and peace</b>. <b class="calibre5">Grace</b> was a common Greek expression, while <b class="calibre5">peace</b> was the common Jewish greeting; and the words were used at meeting or parting. Paul united them, and elevated their meaning and use. <b class="calibre5">Grace</b> pictures God stooping down to sinful, lost humanity in loving and tender compassion. <b class="calibre5">Peace</b> summarizes all that results in the life of a person when he accepts God’s grace as a free gift. R. J. Little said: “Grace can mean many things, and is like a blank check. Peace is definitely part of the Christian’s heritage, and we should not allow Satan to rob us of it.” The order of the words is significant: <b class="calibre5">grace</b> first, then <b class="calibre5">peace</b>. If God had not first acted in love and mercy toward us, we would still be in our sins. But because He took the initiative and sent His Son to die for us, we now can have peace with God, peace with man, and the peace of God in our souls. Even having said all this, one despairs of ever adequately defining such tremendous words as these.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-47" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-60">B. Paul’s Thanksgiving and Prayer for the Believers (1:3–14)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:3</span> Having greeted these saints in terms which have become the watchword of Christianity, the apostle does something else which is very characteristic of him—he falls to his knees in <b class="calibre5">thanks</b> and prayer. It seems that the apostle always began his prayer with praise to the Lord, and this is a good example for us to follow. His prayer is addressed <b class="calibre5">to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. Prayer is the unspeakable privilege of having audience with the Sovereign of the universe. But it may be asked: “How could a mere man dare to stand in the awful presence of the infinitely high God?” The answer is found in our text. The glorious and majestic God of the universe is <b class="calibre5">the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</b>. The One who is infinitely high has become intimately nigh. Because as believers in Christ we share His life, God is our Father also (John 20:17). We can draw near through Christ. <b class="calibre5">Praying always for you.</b> Taken by itself, this expression does not seem remarkable, but it takes on new meaning when we remember that this describes Paul’s interest in people he had never met. We often find it difficult to remember our own relatives and friends before the throne of grace, but think of the prayer list the Apostle Paul must have kept! He prayed not only for those he knew but also for Christians in faraway places whose names had been mentioned to him by others. Truly Paul’s untiring prayer life helps us to understand him better.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:4</span> He had heard of the Colossians’ <b class="calibre5">faith in Christ Jesus and of</b> their <b class="calibre5">love to all the saints</b>. He first mentions their <b class="calibre5">faith in Christ Jesus</b>. That is where we must always begin. There are many religious people in the world today who are constantly talking about their love for others. But if you question them, you find that they do not have any <b class="calibre5">faith in</b> the Lord <b class="calibre5">Jesus</b>. Such love is hollow and meaningless. On the other hand, there are those who profess to have <b class="calibre5">faith in Christ</b>, yet you look in vain for any evidence of <b class="calibre5">love</b> in their lives. Paul would likewise question the sincerity of their faith. There must be true <b class="calibre5">faith</b> in the Savior, and this faith must be evidenced by a life of <b class="calibre5">love</b> to God and to one’s fellow man.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul speaks of <b class="calibre5">faith</b> as being <b class="calibre5">in Christ Jesus</b>. It is very important to notice this. The Lord Jesus Christ is always set forth in Scripture as the Object of faith. A person might have unbounded faith in a bank, but that faith is only valid as long as the bank is reliable. The faith itself will not insure the safety of one’s money if the bank is poorly managed. So it is in the spiritual life. Faith in itself is not sufficient. That faith must be centered in the Lord Jesus Christ. Since He can never fail, no one who trusts Him will ever be disappointed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The fact that Paul had heard of their <b class="calibre5">faith</b> and of their <b class="calibre5">love</b> shows that they certainly were not secret believers. In fact, the NT gives little encouragement to anyone who seeks to go on as a secret disciple. The teaching of the Word of God is that if a person has truly received the Savior, then it is inevitable that he will make public confession of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The love of the Colossians went out to <b class="calibre5">all the saints</b>. There was nothing local or sectarian about their love. They did not love only those of their own fellowship, but wherever they found true believers, their love flowed out freely and warmly. This should be a lesson to us that our love should not be narrow or limited to our own local fellowship, or to missionaries from our own country. We should recognize the sheep of Christ wherever they are found, and manifest our affection to them wherever possible.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:5</span> It is not entirely clear how this verse connects with what has gone before. Is it connected with verse 3: We give thanks … <b class="calibre5">because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven</b>? Or is it connected with the latter part of verse 4: Your love for all the saints, <b class="calibre5">because of the hope which is laid up for you in heaven</b>? Either interpretation is possible. The apostle could be giving thanks, not only for their faith and their love, but also for the future inheritance which would one day be theirs. On the other hand, it is also true that faith in Christ Jesus and love to all the saints are exercised in view of that which lies before us. In any case, we can all see that Paul is here listing the three cardinal virtues of the Christian life: faith, love, and <b class="calibre5">hope</b>. These are also mentioned in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and 1 Thessalonians 1:3; 5:8. Lightfoot says: “Faith rests on the past; love works in the present; hope looks to the future.”<a id="calibre_link-22" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-61">4</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">In this verse, <b class="calibre5">hope</b> does not mean the attitude of waiting or looking forward to something, but rather it refers to that for which a person hopes. Here it means the fulfillment of our salvation when we shall be taken to heaven and will enter into our eternal inheritance. The Colossians had heard about this <b class="calibre5">hope</b> previously, perhaps when Epaphras preached the gospel to them. What they had heard is described as the <b class="calibre5">word of the truth of the gospel</b>. The <b class="calibre5">gospel</b> is here described as a message of <i class="calibre3">true</i> good news. Perhaps Paul was thinking of the <i class="calibre3">false</i> teachings of the Gnostics when he wrote this. Someone has defined “truth” as that which God says about a thing (John 17:17). <b class="calibre5">The gospel</b> is true because it is God’s word.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:6</span> The truth of the gospel had <b class="calibre5">come to</b> the Colossians even <b class="calibre5">as it</b> had <b class="calibre5">in all the</b> then-known <b class="calibre5">world</b>. This must not be taken in an absolute sense. It could not mean that <i class="calibre3">every man and woman</i> in the world had heard the gospel. It may mean, in part, that some from <i class="calibre3">every nation</i> had heard the good news of salvation (Acts 2). It may also mean that the gospel was for all men, and was being spread abroad without purposeful limitation. Paul is also describing the inevitable results which it produced. In Colosse and <b class="calibre5">in all</b> the other parts of <b class="calibre5">the world</b> where the gospel was preached, it bore <b class="calibre5">fruit</b> and was <b class="calibre5">growing</b> (NKJV marg.<a id="calibre_link-23" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-62">5</a>). This is stated to show the supernatural character of the gospel. In nature, a plant does not usually bear fruit and increase at the same time. Many times, it has to be pruned in order to bear fruit, for if it is allowed to grow wild, the result is that all the life of the plant goes into leaves and branches rather than into fruit. But the gospel does both at the same time. It bears <b class="calibre5">fruit</b> in the salvation of souls and in the upbuilding of the saints, and it also spreads from city to city and from nation to nation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This is precisely the effect that the gospel had in the lives of the Colossians <b class="calibre5">since the day</b> they <b class="calibre5">heard and knew the grace of God in truth</b>. There was numerical growth in the church at Colosse, and, in addition, there was spiritual growth in the lives of the believers there.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It appears that great strides had been made in the first century, and that the gospel did reach Europe, Asia, and Africa, going farther than many persons have supposed. Still, there is no ground for thinking that it covered the entire earth. <b class="calibre5">The grace of God</b> is used here as a lovely description of the gospel message. What could more beautifully summarize the glad tidings than the wonderful truth of God’s grace bestowed on guilty men who deserve God’s wrath!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:7</span> The apostle clearly states that it was <b class="calibre5">from Epaphras</b> that the believers had heard the gospel message and had come to know it experientially in their lives. Paul commends Epaphras as a <b class="calibre5">dear fellow servant</b> and <b class="calibre5">a faithful minister of Christ on</b> their <b class="calibre5">behalf</b>. There was nothing of bitterness or jealousy about the Apostle Paul. It did not bother him to see another preacher receiving commendation. In fact, he was the first to express his appreciation for other servants of the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:8</span> It was from Epaphras that Paul himself had heard of the Colossians’ <b class="calibre5">love in the Spirit</b>. This was not a merely human affection, but it was that genuine <b class="calibre5">love</b> for the Lord and for His people which is created by the indwelling <b class="calibre5">Spirit</b> of God. This is the only reference to the Holy Spirit in this Epistle.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:9</span> Having concluded this thanksgiving, Paul now begins to make specific intercession for the saints. We have already mentioned how broad were the apostle’s prayer interests. We should further point out that his requests were always specifically suited to the need of the people of God in any particular location. He did not pray in generalities. Here he seems to make four separate requests for the Colossians: (1) spiritual insight; (2) a worthy walk; (3) abundant power; (4) a thankful spirit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There was nothing mean or stingy about his requests. This is especially obvious in verses 9, 10, and 11 by his use of the words <i class="calibre3">all, fully,</i> and <i class="calibre3">every</i>. (1) <b class="calibre5">All wisdom and spiritual understanding</b> (v. 9). (2) “fully pleasing” (v. 10). (3) “Every good work” (v. 10). (4) “All might” (v. 11). (5) “All patience and longsuffering” (v. 11).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">For this reason</b> connects with the preceding verses. It means <i class="calibre3">because of Epaphras’ report</i> (vv. 4, 5, 8). From the first time he had <b class="calibre5">heard</b> about these dear saints at Colosse and their faith, love, and hope, the apostle had made it his practice to pray for them. First, he prayed that they might <b class="calibre5">be filled with the knowledge of</b> God’s <b class="calibre5">will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding</b>. He did not ask that they should be satisfied with the boasted knowledge of the Gnostics. He would have them enter into the full <b class="calibre5">knowledge of</b> God’s <b class="calibre5">will</b> for their lives as revealed in His word. This knowledge is not of a worldly or carnal nature; it is characterized by spiritual <b class="calibre5">wisdom and spiritual understanding—wisdom</b> to apply the knowledge in the best way, and <b class="calibre5">understanding</b> to see what agrees and what conflicts with God’s will.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:10</span> There is a very important connection between verse 10 and verse 9. Why did the Apostle Paul want the Colossians to be filled with the knowledge of God’s will? Was it so they might become mighty preachers or sensational teachers? Was it so they might attract large followings to themselves, as the Gnostics sought to do? No, the true purpose of spiritual wisdom and understanding is to enable Christians to <b class="calibre5">walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him</b>. Here we have a very important lesson on the subject of guidance. God does not reveal His will to us in order to satisfy our curiosity. Neither is it intended to cater to our ambition or pride. Rather the Lord shows us His will for our lives in order that we might please Him in all that we do.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Being fruitful in every good work.</b> Here is a helpful reminder that although a person is not saved <i class="calibre3">by</i> good works, he most certainly is saved <i class="calibre3">for</i> good works. Sometimes in emphasizing the utter worthlessness of good works in the salvation of souls, we may create the impression that Christians do not believe in good works. Nothing could be further from the truth! We learn in Ephesians 2:10 that “we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works.” Again, Paul wrote to Titus: “This is a faithful saying, and these things I want you to affirm constantly, that those who have believed in God should be careful to maintain good works” (Tit. 3:8).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only did Paul want them to bear fruit <b class="calibre5">in every good work</b>, but also to increase <b class="calibre5">in the knowledge of God</b>. How is this done? First of all, it is done through the diligent study of God’s word. Then it is also found in obeying His teachings and serving Him faithfully. (The latter seems to be the prominent thought here.) As we do these things, we enter into a deeper <b class="calibre5">knowledge of</b> the Lord. “Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord (Hos. 6:3 KJV).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Notice the repetition of words dealing with knowledge in chapter 1 and realize that there is a definite advance in thought with each use. In verse 6, they “<i class="calibre3">knew</i> the grace of God.” In verse 9, they had “the <i class="calibre3">knowledge</i> of His will.” In verse 10, they were “<i class="calibre3">increasing</i> in the <i class="calibre3">knowledge</i> of God.” Perhaps we could say that the first refers to salvation, the second to study of the Scriptures, and the third to service and Christian living. Sound doctrine should lead to right conduct, which expresses itself in obedient service.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:11</span> The apostle’s third request is that the saints might be <b class="calibre5">strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power</b>. (Note the progression: <i class="calibre3">filled</i>, v. 9; <i class="calibre3">fruitful</i>, v. 10; <i class="calibre3">fortified</i>, v. 11.) The Christian life cannot be lived by mere human energy. It requires supernatural strength. Therefore Paul desires that the believers might know the power of the risen Son of God, and he furthermore desires that they should know this <b class="calibre5">according to His glorious power</b>. The request is not that this power might be <i class="calibre3">out of</i> His glorious power, but <b class="calibre5">according to</b> it. <b class="calibre5">His glorious power</b> is limitless and that is just the scope of the prayer. Peake writes: “The equipment with power is proportional not simply to the recipient’s need, but to the Divine supply.”<a id="calibre_link-24" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-63">6</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Why did Paul want the Christians to have this power? Was it so they might go out and perform spectacular miracles? Was it so they might raise the dead, heal the sick, cast out demons? Once again the answer is “No.” This power is needed so that the child of God may have <b class="calibre5">all patience and longsuffering with joy</b>. This deserves careful attention! In parts of Christendom today, great emphasis is placed upon so-called miracles, such as speaking in tongues, healing the sick, and similar sensational acts. But there is a greater miracle than all of these in the age in which we live: A child of God suffering patiently and thanking God in the midst of the trial!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In 1 Corinthians 13:4, longsuffering is connected with kindness; here with <b class="calibre5">joy</b>. We suffer because we cannot escape sharing the groaning of creation. To maintain <b class="calibre5">joy</b> within and kindness to others requires God’s power, and is Christian victory. The difference between <b class="calibre5">patience</b> and <b class="calibre5">longsuffering</b> has been defined as the difference between enduring without complaint and enduring without retaliation. God’s grace has achieved one of its greatest objects in the life of the believer who can suffer patiently and praise God in the midst of the fiery trial.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:12</span> <b class="calibre5">Giving thanks</b> in this verse refers to the Colossians, not Paul (it is plural in the original). Paul is praying that they might not only be strengthened with all might but that they also might have a thankful spirit, that they might never fail to express their gratitude <b class="calibre5">to the Father</b>, who <b class="calibre5">qualified</b> them <b class="calibre5">to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light</b>. As sons of Adam, we were not fit to enjoy the glories of heaven. In fact, if unsaved people could somehow be taken to heaven, they would not enjoy it, but would rather be in the deepest misery. Appreciation of heaven requires a fitness for it. Even as believers in the Lord Jesus, we do not have any fitness for heaven in ourselves. The only title to glory which we have is found in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">I stand upon His merit,</p>
        <p class="sl">I know no other stand,</p>
        <p class="sl">Not e’en where glory dwelleth,</p>
        <p class="sl">In Immanuel’s land.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Anne Ross Cousin</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">When God saves someone, He instantly bestows on that person fitness for heaven. That fitness is Christ. Nothing can improve on that. Not even a long life of obedience and service here on earth makes a person more fit for heaven than he was the day he was saved. Our title to glory is found in His blood. While the inheritance is <b class="calibre5">in the light</b> and “reserved in heaven,” we believers on earth have the Holy Spirit as the “guarantee of our inheritance.” Therefore we can rejoice in what lies ahead for us, while enjoying even now the “firstfruits of the Spirit.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:13</span> In making us “qualified … to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light,” God <b class="calibre5">has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love</b> (cf. 1 Jn. 2:11). This can be illustrated by the experience of the children of Israel, as recorded in Exodus. They had been living in Egypt, groaning under the lashes of the taskmasters there. By a marvelous act of divine intervention, God delivered them out of that fearful bondage and led them through the wilderness to the promised land. Similarly, as sinners we were in bondage to Satan, but through Christ we have been <b class="calibre5">delivered from</b> his clutches and now we are subjects of Christ’s <b class="calibre5">kingdom</b>. Satan’s kingdom is one of <b class="calibre5">darkness</b>—an absence of light, warmth, and joy; while the <b class="calibre5">kingdom</b> of Christ is one of <b class="calibre5">love</b>, which implies the presence of all three.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">The kingdom</b> of Christ is seen in Scripture in several different aspects. When He came to the earth the first time, He offered a literal kingdom to the nation of Israel. The Jews wanted deliverance from the Roman oppressor, but they did not want to repent of their sins. Christ could only reign over a people who were in proper spiritual relationship to Him. When that was made clear to them, they rejected their King and crucified Him. Since then, the Lord Jesus has gone back to heaven and we now have the kingdom in mystery form (Matt. 13). This means that the kingdom does not appear in visible form. The King is absent. But all who accept the Lord Jesus Christ during this present age acknowledge Him as their rightful Ruler, and thus they are subjects of His kingdom. In a coming day, the Lord Jesus will come back to earth, set up His kingdom with Jerusalem as capital, and reign for one thousand years. At the end of that time, Christ will put down all enemies under His feet and then deliver up the kingdom to God the Father. That will inaugurate the eternal kingdom, which will continue throughout eternity.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:14</span> Having mentioned the kingdom of the Son of God’s love, Paul now launches into one of the grandest passages in all the word of God on the Person and work of the Lord Jesus. It is hard for us to know whether he has finished his prayer, or whether it continues through these verses we are about to study. But it is not of great importance, because even if the following verses are not pure prayer, they certainly are pure worship.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Sturz has pointed out that “in this amazing passage which exalts Jesus Christ more than any other, His name does not appear even once in any form.” While this is remarkable in one sense, yet it is not to be wondered at. For who else but our blessed Savior could ever fulfill the description which is given to us here? The passage reminds us of Mary’s question to the gardener: “Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away” (John 20:15). She did not name Him. There <i class="calibre3">was</i> only one Person to her mind.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christ is first presented as the One <b class="calibre5">in whom we have redemption</b> … ,<a id="calibre_link-25" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-64">7</a> <b class="calibre5">the forgiveness of sins. Redemption</b> describes the act whereby we were bought from the slave market of sin. The Lord Jesus, as it were, put a price tag on us. How highly did He value us? He said, in effect, “I value them so highly that I am willing to shed My blood to purchase them.” Since we have been purchased at such a tremendous cost, it should be clear to us that we no longer belong to ourselves; we have been bought with a price. Therefore we should not live our lives the way we choose. Borden of Yale pointed out that if we take our lives and do what we want with them, we are taking something that does not belong to us, and therefore we are thieves!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only has He redeemed us; He has given us <b class="calibre5">the forgiveness of sins</b>. This means that God has cancelled the debt which our sins incurred. The Lord Jesus Christ paid the penalty on the cross; it never needs to be paid again. The account is settled and closed, and God has not only forgiven, but He has removed our sins as far as the east is from the west (Ps. 103:12).</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-48" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-65">C. The Glories of Christ the Church’s Head (1:15–23)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:15</span> In the next four verses, we have the Lord Jesus described: (1) in His relationship to God (v. 15); (2) in His relationship to creation (vv. 16, 17); and (3) in His relationship to the church (v. 18).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Lord is here described as <b class="calibre5">the image of the invisible God. Image</b> carries with it at least two ideas. First, it conveys the thought that the Lord Jesus has enabled us to see what God is like. God is Spirit and is therefore invisible. But in the Person of Christ, God made Himself visible to mortal eyes. In that sense the Lord Jesus is <b class="calibre5">the image of the invisible God</b>. Whoever has seen Him has seen the Father (see John 14:9). But the word <b class="calibre5">image</b> also conveys the idea of “representative.” God had originally placed Adam on the earth to represent His interests, but Adam failed. Therefore, God sent His only begotten Son into the world as His Representative to care for His interests and to reveal His heart of love to man. In that sense, He is the image of God. The same word <b class="calibre5">image</b> is used in 3:10, where believers are said to be the image of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christ is also <b class="calibre5">the firstborn over all creation</b>, or “of every created being.” What does this mean? Some false teachers suggest that the Lord Jesus is Himself a created being, that He was the first Person whom God ever made. Some of them are even willing to go so far as to admit that He is the greatest creature ever to come from the hand of God. But nothing could be more directly contrary to the teaching of the word of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The expression “firstborn” has at least three different meanings in Scripture. In Luke 2:7, it is used in <i class="calibre3">a literal sense</i>, where Mary brought forth her firstborn Son. There it means that the Lord Jesus was the first Child to whom she gave birth. In Exodus 4:22, on the other hand, it is used in <i class="calibre3">a figurative sense</i>. “Israel is My son, even My firstborn.” In that verse there is no thought of an actual birth having taken place, but the Lord is using this word to describe the distinctive place which the nation of Israel had in His plans and purposes. Finally, in Psalm 89:27, the word “firstborn” is used to designate <i class="calibre3">a place of superiority</i>, of supremacy, of uniqueness. There God says that He will make David His firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. David was actually the last-born son of Jesse according to the flesh. But God determined to give him a place of unique supremacy, primacy, and sovereignty.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Is not that exactly the thought of Colossians 1:15—<b class="calibre5">the firstborn over all creation</b>? The Lord Jesus Christ is God’s unique Son. In one sense all believers are sons of God, but the Lord Jesus is God’s Son in a way that is not true of any other. He existed before all creation and occupies a position of supremacy over it. His is the rank of eminence and dominion. The expression <b class="calibre5">firstborn over all creation</b> has nothing to do with birth here. It simply means that He is God’s Son by an eternal relationship. It is a title of priority of <i class="calibre3">position</i>, and not simply one of time.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:16</span> False teachers use verse 15 (especially in the KJV) to teach that the Lord Jesus was a created being. Error can usually be refuted from the very passage of Scripture which the cultists use. That is the case here. Verse 16 states conclusively that the Lord Jesus is not a creature, but the very Creator. In this verse we learn that <b class="calibre5">all things</b>—the whole universe of things—<b class="calibre5">were created</b> not only <b class="calibre5">by Him</b> but <b class="calibre5">through Him and for Him</b>. Each of these prepositions conveys a different thought. First of all, we read that <b class="calibre5">by Him all things were created</b>. Here the thought is that the power to create was in His Being. He was the Architect. Later in the verse we learn that <b class="calibre5">all things were created through Him</b>. This speaks of Him as the Agent in creation. He was the Person of the Godhead through whom the creative act was performed. Also, all things were created <b class="calibre5">for Him</b>. He is the One for whom all things were created, the goal of creation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul goes to great lengths to emphasize that <b class="calibre5">all things were created through</b> Christ, whether things <b class="calibre5">in heaven</b>, or things <b class="calibre5">on earth</b>. This leaves no loopholes for anyone to suggest that although He created some things, He Himself was created originally.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The apostle then goes on to state that the Lord’s creation included things <b class="calibre5">visible and</b> things <b class="calibre5">invisible</b>. The word <b class="calibre5">visible</b> needs no explanation, but doubtless the Apostle Paul realized that when he said <b class="calibre5">invisible</b> he would arouse our curiosity. Therefore, he proceeds to give a break-down of what he means by things <b class="calibre5">invisible</b>. They include <b class="calibre5">thrones, dominions, principalities</b>, and <b class="calibre5">powers</b>. We believe that these terms refer to angelic beings, although we cannot distinguish between the different ranks of these intelligent beings.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Gnostics taught that there were various ranks and classes of spirit beings between God and matter, and that Christ belonged to one of these classes. In our day the Spiritists claim that Jesus Christ is an advanced spirit of the sixth sphere. Jehovah’s Witnesses teach that before our Lord came into the world, He was a created angel and none other than the archangel Michael! Here Paul vigorously refutes such absurd notions by stating in the clearest possible terms that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Creator of angels—in fact, of all beings, whether <b class="calibre5">visible</b> or <b class="calibre5">invisible</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:17</span> <b class="calibre5">He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.</b> Paul says, “He <b class="calibre5">is</b> before all things,” not “He <i class="calibre3">was</i> before all things.” The present tense is often used in the Bible to describe the timelessness of Deity. The Lord Jesus said, for instance: “Before Abraham was, I AM” (John 8:58).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only did the Lord Jesus exist before there was any creation, but also <b class="calibre5">in Him all things consist</b>. This means that He is the Sustainer of the universe and the Source of its perpetual motion. He controls the stars and the sun and the moon. Even while He was here on earth He was the One who was controlling the laws by which our universe functions in an orderly manner.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:18</span> The dominion of the Lord Jesus not only covers the natural universe, but it also extends to the spiritual realm. <b class="calibre5">He is the head of the body, the church</b>. All believers in the Lord Jesus during this dispensation are formed into what is known as <b class="calibre5">the body</b> of Christ, or <b class="calibre5">the church</b>. Just as a human body is a vehicle by which the person expresses himself, so the Body of Christ is that vehicle which He has on earth by which He chooses to express Himself to the world. And <b class="calibre5">He is the head of</b> that <b class="calibre5">body</b>. The head speaks of guidance, dictation, control. He occupies the place of <b class="calibre5">pre-eminence</b> in the church.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">He is <b class="calibre5">the beginning</b>. We understand this to mean <b class="calibre5">the beginning</b> of the new creation (see Rev. 3:14), the source of spiritual life. This is further explained by the use of the expression <b class="calibre5">the firstborn from the dead</b>. Here again we must be careful to emphasize that this does not mean that the Lord Jesus was the first to rise from the dead. There were cases of resurrection in the OT as well as in the NT. But the Lord Jesus was the first to rise from the dead <i class="calibre3">to die no more</i>, He was the first to rise with a glorified body, and He rose as the Head of a new creation. His resurrection is unique, and is the pledge that all who trust in Him will also rise. It proclaims Him as supreme in the spiritual creation.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Alfred Mace put it well:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Christ cannot be second anywhere. He is “firstborn of every creature,” because He has created everything (Col. 1:15, 16). He is also firstborn from the dead in connection with a redeemed and heavenly family. Thus creation and redemption hand the honors of supremacy to Him because of Who He is and of what He has done; “that in all things He might have the pre-eminence.” He is first everywhere.<a id="calibre_link-26" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-66">8</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">The Lord Jesus has thus a double pre-eminence—first in creation, and then in the church. God has decreed that in <i class="calibre3">all things</i> <b class="calibre5">HE may have the preeminence.</b> What an answer this is to those who, in Paul’s day (and our own), would seek to rob Christ of His deity, and to make of Him only a created being, however exalted!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As we read <b class="calibre5">that in all things He may have the preeminence</b>, it is only proper that we should ask ourselves, “Does He have the preeminence in my life?”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:19</span> Darby translates verse 19 as follows: “For in Him all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell.” The King James tradition could make it sound as if at some point in time the Father (notice italics for words not in the Greek) was pleased to make all fullness dwell in the Son. The real meaning is that <b class="calibre5">the fullness</b> of the Godhead always dwelt in Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Gnostic heretics taught that Christ was a kind of “halfway house” to God, a necessary link in the chain. But there were other, better links on ahead. “Go on from Him,” they urged, “and you will reach the fullness.” “No,” Paul answers, “Christ is Himself the complete fullness!”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">All fullness <i class="calibre3">dwells</i> in Christ. The word for <b class="calibre5">dwell</b> here means to dwell permanently,<a id="calibre_link-27" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-67">9</a> and not simply to visit temporarily.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:20</span> Verse 19 is connected with verse 20 as follows: “For it pleased <i class="calibre3">the Father</i> <b class="calibre5">by Him</b> (Christ) <b class="calibre5">to reconcile all things to Himself … having made peace through the blood of His cross.”</b> In other words, it was not only the Godhead’s good pleasure that all fullness should dwell in Christ (v. 19), but also that Christ should <b class="calibre5">reconcile all things to Himself</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are two reconciliations mentioned in this chapter: (1) The reconciliation of <b class="calibre5">things</b> (v. 20), and (2) the reconciliation of persons (v. 21). The first is still future, whereas the second is past for all who have believed in Christ.</p>

        <p class="sbaft"><i class="calibre3">To reconcile</i> means to restore to a right relationship or standard, or to make peace where formerly there was enmity. The Bible never speaks of God as needing to be reconciled to man, but always of man being reconciled to God. The carnal mind is enmity toward God (Rom. 8:7), and because of this, man needs to be reconciled.</p>
        <p class="sb">When sin entered the world, man became estranged from God. He adopted an attitude of hostility toward God. Therefore, he needed to be reconciled.</p>
        <p class="sb">But sin affected all of creation, not just the human family.</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. Certain of the angels had sinned sometime in the past. (However, there is no indication in God’s word that these angels will ever be reconciled. They are “reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day” [Jude 6].) In Job 4:18, Eliphaz states that God charged His angels with folly.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. The animal creation was affected by the entrance of sin: “For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility…. For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now” (Rom. 8:19–22). The fact that animals suffer sickness, pain, and death is evidence that they are not exempt from the curse of sin.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="3">3. The ground was cursed by God after Adam sinned (Gen. 3:17). This is evidenced by weeds, thorns, and thistles.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="4">4. In the book of Job, Bildad tells us that even the stars are not pure in God’s sight (Job 25:5), so apparently sin has affected the stellar world.</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="5">5. Hebrews 9:23 says that things in heaven itself needed to be purified. We do not know all that is meant by this, but perhaps it suggests that heavenly things have been defiled through the presence of Satan, who has access to God as the accuser of the brethren (Job 1:6, 7; Rev. 12:10). Some think this passage refers to the dwelling place of God; others to the stellar heavens. The latter suggests that it is in the stellar spaces that Satan has access to God. In any case, all agree that the throne of God is certainly not defiled by sin.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="sb">One of the purposes of the death of Christ was to make possible the reconciliation of persons and things to God. In order to do this, He had to remove the cause of enmity and alienation. This He effectively did by settling the sin question to God’s entire satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="sb">The scope of reconciliation is indicated in Colossians 1, as follows. (1) All who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ are already reconciled to God (v. 21). Although Christ’s reconciling work is sufficient for all mankind, it is only effective for those who avail themselves of it. (2) Eventually all things will be reconciled, whether things on earth or things in heaven (v. 20). This refers to the animal creation, and to inanimate things that have been defiled by sin. However, it does not refer to Satan, to other fallen angels, or to unbelieving men. Their eternal doom is clearly pronounced in the Scriptures.</p>
        <p class="sb">Reconciliation is not said to extend to “things under the earth.” There is a difference between reconciliation and subjugation. The latter is described in Philippians 2:10: “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth.” Or, as Darby translates it, “of heavenly and earthly and infernal beings.” All created beings, even fallen angels, will eventually be compelled to bow to the Lord Jesus, but this does not mean that they will be reconciled. We emphasize this because Colossians 1:20 has been used to teach the false doctrine of universal salvation—namely, that Satan himself, fallen angels, and unbelieving men will all be reconciled to God eventually. Our passage limits the extent of reconciliation by the phrase things on earth or things in heaven. “Things under the earth,” or infernal things, are not included.</p>

      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:21</span> Paul reminds the Colossians that reconciliation in their case was already an accomplished fact. Before their conversion, the Colossians had been Gentile sinners, <b class="calibre5">alienated</b> from God and <b class="calibre5">enemies</b> of His in their minds because of their <b class="calibre5">wicked works</b> (Eph. 4:17, 18). They desperately needed to be reconciled, and the Lord Jesus Christ, in His matchless grace, had taken the initiative.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:22</span> He reconciled them <b class="calibre5">in the body of His flesh through death</b>. It was not by His life but by His <b class="calibre5">death</b>. The expression <b class="calibre5">the body of His flesh</b> simply means that the Lord Jesus effected reconciliation by dying on the cross in a real human <b class="calibre5">body</b> (not as a spirit being, which the Gnostics claimed Him to be). Compare Hebrews 2:14–16, where Christ’s Incarnation is declared a necessity in order to effect redemption. The Gnostic concept denied this.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The wonderful result of this reconciliation is expressed in the words <b class="calibre5">to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight</b>. What marvelous grace, that ungodly sinners can be delivered from their past evil life and conveyed into such a realm of blessing!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Well might C. R. Erdman say: “In Christ is found a God who is near, who cares, who hears, who pities and who saves.”<a id="calibre_link-28" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-68">10</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">The full efficacy of Christ’s reconciliation with regard to His people will be seen in a coming day when we are presented to God the Father without sin, stain, or any charge against us, and when, as worshipers, we shall gladly acknowledge Christ as the Worthy One (Rev. 5).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:23</span> Now the Apostle Paul adds one of those <b class="calibre5">if</b><a id="calibre_link-29" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-69">11</a> passages which have proved very disconcerting to many children of God. On the surface, the verse seems to teach that our continued salvation depends on our continuing <b class="calibre5">in the faith</b>. If this is so, how can this verse be reconciled with other portions of the word of God, such as John 10:28, 29, which declare that no sheep of Christ can ever perish?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In seeking to answer this question, we would like to state at the outset that the eternal security of the believer is a blessed truth which is set forth clearly in the pages of the NT. However, the Scriptures also teach, as in this verse, that true faith always has the quality of permanence, and that one who has really been born of God will go on faithfully to the end. Continuance is a proof of reality. Of course there is always the danger of backsliding, but a Christian falls only to rise again (Prov. 24:16). He does not forsake the faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Spirit of God has seen fit to put many of these so-called “if” passages in the word of God in order to challenge all who profess the name of Christ as to the reality of their profession. We would not want to say anything that might dull the sharp edge of these passages. As someone has said: “These ‘ifs’ in Scripture look on professing Christians here in the world and they come as healthy tests to the soul.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Pridham comments on these challenging verses as follows:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The reader will find, on a careful study of the Word, that it is the habit of the Spirit to accompany the fullest and most absolute statements of grace by warnings which imply a ruinous failure on the part of some who nominally stand in faith…. Warnings which grate harshly on the ears of insincere profession are drunk willingly as medicine by the godly soul…. The aim of all such teaching as we have here is to encourage faith, and condemn, by anticipation, reckless and self-confident professors.<a id="calibre_link-30" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-70">12</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Doubtless with the Gnostics primarily in mind, the apostle is urging the Colossians <b class="calibre5">not</b> to be <b class="calibre5">moved away from the hope</b> that accompanies <b class="calibre5">the gospel</b>, or which the <b class="calibre5">gospel</b> inspires. They should <b class="calibre5">continue in the faith</b> which they learned from Epaphras, <b class="calibre5">grounded and steadfast.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">Again Paul speaks of the gospel as having been <b class="calibre5">preached to every creature</b> (or “all creation”) <b class="calibre5">under heaven</b>. The gospel goes out to all creation, but it has not as yet reached literally every creature. Paul is arguing the worldwide proclamation of the gospel as a testimonial to its genuineness. He sees in this the evidence that it is adaptable to the needs of mankind everywhere. The verse does not mean that every person in the world at that time had heard the gospel. It was not a fact accomplished, but a process going on. Also, the gospel had reached to all the Bible world, that is, the Mediterranean world.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul speaks of himself as <b class="calibre5">a minister</b>, a Latin word that simply means “a servant.” It has nothing of officialdom about it. It does not denote a lofty office so much as humble service.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-49" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-71">D. The Ministry Committed to Paul (1:24–29)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">1:24</span> The last six verses of chapter 1 describe Paul’s ministry. First of all, it was carried out in an atmosphere of suffering. Writing from prison, Paul can say that he <b class="calibre5">now</b> rejoices <b class="calibre5">in</b> his <b class="calibre5">sufferings for</b> the saints, that is, on their account. As a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, he was called upon to endure untold hardships, persecutions, and <b class="calibre5">afflictions</b>. These to him were a privilege—the privilege of filling up that which was left behind of <b class="calibre5">the afflictions of Christ</b>. What does the apostle mean by this? First of all, this cannot refer to the <i class="calibre3">atoning</i> sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross. Those were finished once and for all, and no man could ever share in them. But there is a sense in which the Lord Jesus still suffers. When Saul of Tarsus was struck to the ground on the road to Damascus, he heard a voice from heaven saying, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?” Saul had not been consciously persecuting the Lord—he had only been persecuting the Christians. He learned, however, that in persecuting believers, he was persecuting their Savior. The Head in heaven feels the sufferings of His Body on earth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus, the Apostle Paul looks on all the suffering that Christians are required to go through for the sake of the Lord Jesus as being part of the sufferings of Christ which still remain. They include suffering for righteousness’ sake, suffering for His sake (bearing His reproach), and for the gospel’s sake.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But <b class="calibre5">the afflictions of Christ</b> refer not only to sufferings <i class="calibre3">for</i> Christ. They also describe <i class="calibre3">the same kind of</i> sufferings that the Savior endured when He was here, though far less in degree.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The afflictions endured by the apostle <b class="calibre5">in</b> his <b class="calibre5">flesh</b> were <b class="calibre5">for the sake of</b> Christ’s <b class="calibre5">body</b>, namely, <b class="calibre5">the church</b>. The sufferings of unsaved people are, in a sense, purposeless. There is no high dignity attached to them. They are only a foretaste of the pangs of hell to be endured forever. But not so the sufferings of Christians. When they suffer for Christ, Christ in a very real way suffers with them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:25</span> <b class="calibre5">Of which I became a minister.</b> Paul had already used this expression at the close of verse 23. Now he repeats it. However, there is a difference in these two usages. The apostle had a twofold ministry: first, he was commissioned to preach the gospel (v. 23); and secondly, he was sent forth to teach the marvelous mystery of the church (v. 25). There is a real lesson in this for every true servant of Christ. We are not expected simply to lead men to Christ by the gospel and then abandon them to get along as best they can. Rather, we are expected to direct our evangelistic efforts to the formation of local NT churches where the converts can be built up in their most holy faith, including the truth of the church. The Lord wants His babes to be directed to feeding stations where they will be nourished and where they can grow.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Thus in Colossians 1 we have seen (1) Christ’s twofold preeminence, (2) Christ’s twofold reconciliation, and (3) Paul’s twofold ministry. Here in verse 25, when Paul says, <b class="calibre5">“of which I became a minister,”</b> he is referring to his ministry with regard to the church and not the gospel. This is clear from the expression which follows: <b class="calibre5">According to the stewardship</b> (or “dispensation”) <b class="calibre5">from God given to me for you</b>. A steward is one who cares for the interests or property of another. Paul was a steward in the sense that the great truth of the church was entrusted to him in a very special way. While the mystery of the Body of Christ was not revealed to him alone, yet he was chosen as the one who would carry this precious truth to the Gentiles. It includes the unique position of the church in its relation to Christ and the dispensations, with its constitution, its distinctive hope and destiny, and the many other truths concerning its life and order which God gave to Paul and the other apostles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When he says, <b class="calibre5">which was given to me for you</b>, he is thinking of the Colossians as Gentile believers. The Apostle Peter had been sent to preach to the Jewish people, while Paul had been entrusted with a similar mission to the Gentiles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">One of the most difficult expressions in this chapter is <b class="calibre5">to fulfill the word of God</b>. Exactly what does Paul mean by this? First of all, we know that he does not mean that he completed the word of God by adding the last book to it. As far as we know, the book of Revelation, written by John, was the last book to be added to the NT in point of time. In what sense, then, did Paul <b class="calibre5">fulfill</b> or complete <b class="calibre5">the word of God</b>?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">First of all, <b class="calibre5">to fulfill</b> may mean to declare fully, to make known. Thus, Paul had declared the whole counsel of God. We would suggest secondly that he fulfilled the word of God doctrinally. The great truth of the mystery forms the capstone of the NT revelation. In a very real way, it completes the circle of subjects that are covered in the NT. While other books were written later than Paul’s, yet they do not contain any great mysteries of the faith that are not found in the writings of the Apostle Paul. In a very real sense the revelations concerning the mystery of the church filled up the word of God. Nothing that was added later was new truth in the same sense.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:26</span> That Paul’s fulfilling of the word of God had to do with <b class="calibre5">the mystery</b> is borne out in this verse, namely, <b class="calibre5">the mystery which has been hidden from ages and from generations, but now has been revealed to His saints</b>. In the NT, a mystery is a truth not previously revealed, but now made known to the sons of men through the apostles and prophets of the NT. It is a truth that man could never have arrived at by his own intelligence but which God has graciously deigned to make known.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse is one of the many in the NT which teach that the truth of the church was not known in the OT period. It had <b class="calibre5">been hidden from ages and from generations</b> (Eph. 3:2–13; Rom. 16:25–27). Thus it is wrong to speak of the church as having begun with Adam or Abraham. The church began on the Day of Pentecost, and the truth of the church was revealed by the apostles. The church in the NT is not the same as Israel in the Old. It is something that never previously existed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Israel began with God calling Abraham out from Ur of the Chaldees, giving up the rest of the nations to their sins and idolatry. He made a nation out of Abraham’s seed, distinct from all others and separate from them. The church is the reverse of this, and is a union of believers from all races and nationalities into one Body, morally and spiritually separated from all others. That the church is not the continuation of Israel can be seen from a number of things, one being the figure of the “olive tree” which Paul uses in Romans 11 to show that the nation of Israel retains its identity, though the individual Jew who believes in Christ becomes part of the church (Col. 3:10, 11).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:27</span> The truth of <b class="calibre5">this mystery</b> may be summarized as follows: (1) The church is the Body of Christ. All true believers are members of the Body, and are destined to share Christ’s glory forever. (2) The Lord Jesus is the Head of the Body, providing its life, nourishment, and direction. (3) Jews have no preference as to admission to the church; neither are Gentiles at any disadvantage. Both Jew and Gentile become members of the Body through faith and form one new man (Eph. 2:15; 3:6). That Gentiles could be saved was not a hidden truth in the OT; but that converted Gentiles would be fellow members of the Body of Christ, to be His companions in glory, and to reign with Him, was a truth never previously known.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The particular aspect of the mystery which Paul is emphasizing in verse 27 is that the Lord Jesus is willing to dwell within the Gentile heart. <b class="calibre5">Christ in you, the hope of glory.</b> This was spoken to the Colossians, who were Gentiles. F. B. Meyer exclaims: “That He should dwell in the heart of a child of Abraham was deemed a marvelous act of condescension, but that He should find a home in the heart of a Gentile was incredible.” And yet that is exactly what was involved in the mystery—“that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel” (Eph. 3:6). To emphasize the importance of this truth, the apostle does not merely say “this mystery” or “the glory of this mystery,” but <b class="calibre5">the riches of the glory of this mystery</b>. He piles words upon words in order to impress his readers with the fact that this is a glorious truth that deserves their closest attention.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</b> The indwelling <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> is the believers’ <b class="calibre5">hope of glory</b>. We have no other title to heaven than the Savior Himself. The fact that He indwells us makes heaven as sure as if we were already there.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:28</span> The expression <b class="calibre5">Him we preach</b> is significant. The <b class="calibre5">Him</b>, of course, refers back to the Lord Jesus Christ (v. 27). Paul is saying that he preached a Person. He did not spend his time on politics or philosophy, but concentrated on the Lord Jesus Himself, because he realized that Christianity is Christ. <b class="calibre5">Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus</b>. Here we have further insight into the ministry of the beloved apostle. It was a man-to-man ministry. He warned the unsaved of the awful wrath to come, and he taught the saints the great truths of the Christian faith.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then we see the emphasis which he placed on follow-up work. He felt a real sense of responsibility toward those whom he had pointed to the Savior. He was not satisfied to see souls saved and then to pass on. He wanted to <b class="calibre5">present every man perfect in Christ Jesus</b>. Paul pictures himself as a priest offering up sacrifices to God. The sacrifices here are men and women. In what condition does he offer them to the Lord? Are they weak or mere babes in Christ? No, he wants them to be mature, full-grown, adult Christians. He wants them to be well-grounded in the truth. Do we share a similar burden for those whom we have led to Christ?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">1:29</span> It was toward this goal that the apostle labored, as well as all the other apostles. And yet he realized that he was not doing this in his own strength, but <b class="calibre5">according to His working which</b> worked <b class="calibre5">in</b> him <b class="calibre5">mightily</b>. In other words, he realized that it was only as he was empowered by the Lord that he was able to serve Him at all. He was conscious of the fact that the Lord was <b class="calibre5">working in</b> him <b class="calibre5">mightily</b> as he went from place to place planting churches and feeding the saints of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Verses 28 and 29 are especially helpful in Phillips’ translation:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="crtf">So, naturally, we proclaim Christ. We warn everyone we meet, and we teach everyone we can, all that we know about Him, so that, if possible, we may bring every man up to his full maturity in Christ. This is what I am working at all the time, with all the strength that God gives me.</p>
      </div>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-50" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-72">E. Christ’s Sufficiency against the Perils of Philosophy, Legalism, Mysticism, and Asceticism (2:1–23)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">2:1</span> This verse is closely linked with the last two verses of chapter 1. There the Apostle Paul had been describing his strivings, by teaching and preaching, to present every believer mature in Christ. Here his strivings are of a different nature. Now they are spoken of as <b class="calibre5">great conflict</b> in prayer. And here this <b class="calibre5">great conflict</b> is in behalf of those he had never met. From the first day he had heard of the Colossians, he had prayed for them as well as for <b class="calibre5">those in</b> the neighboring city of <b class="calibre5">Laodicea</b>, and for other Christians whom he had not as yet met (see Rev. 3:14–19 for the later sad state of the church there).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Verse 1 is a comfort to those who are never privileged to engage in public ministry. It teaches that we need not be limited by what we can do in the presence of people. We can serve the Lord in the privacy of our rooms on our knees. If we do serve publicly, our effectiveness depends largely on our private devotions before God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:2</span> The exact content of Paul’s prayer is given in this verse. The first part of the prayer is <b class="calibre5">that their hearts may be encouraged</b>. The Colossians were in danger of the teachings of the Gnostics. Therefore, <b class="calibre5">encouraged</b> here means confirmed or strengthened.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The second part of the prayer is that they might be <b class="calibre5">knit together in love</b>. If the saints went on in happy, loving fellowship with one another, they would present a solid flank against the onslaughts of the foe. Also, if their hearts were warm in love to Christ, He would reveal to them the deeper truths of the Christian faith. It is a well-known principle of Scripture that the Lord reveals His secrets to those who are close to Him. John, for instance, was the apostle who leaned on Jesus’ chest, and it was no coincidence that he was also the one to whom the great revelation of Jesus Christ was given.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Next Paul prayed that they might enter into <b class="calibre5">all</b> the <b class="calibre5">riches of the full assurance of understanding</b>. The more they entered into an <b class="calibre5">understanding</b> of the Christian faith, the more fully convinced they would be of its truthfulness. The more firmly grounded the Christians were in the faith, the less would be the danger of their being led away by the false teachings of the day.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The expression <b class="calibre5">full assurance</b> is used three times in the NT. (1) Full assurance of <i class="calibre3">faith</i>—we rest on God’s word, His testimony to us (Heb. 10:22). (2) Full assurance of <i class="calibre3">understanding</i>—we know and are assured (Col. 2:2). (3) Full assurance of <i class="calibre3">hope</i>—we press on with confidence as to the outcome (Heb. 6:11).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The climax of Paul’s prayer is found in the words <b class="calibre5">to the knowledge of the mystery of God, both of the Father and of Christ</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What does Paul mean when he says that they may know <b class="calibre5">the mystery of God … and of Christ</b>? He is still referring to the truth of the church—Christ, the Head of the Body, and all believers members of the Body. But the particular aspect of the mystery which he has in mind is the headship of Christ. He is anxious that the saints should acknowledge this truth. He knows that if they realize the greatness of their Head, they will not be drawn away by Gnosticism or the other evil cults that threatened them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul wants the saints to use Christ, to utilize His resources, to draw upon Him in every emergency. He wants them to see that Christ, who, as Alfred Mace puts it:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">… is <i class="calibre3">in</i> His people, is possessed of every attribute of deity, and of infinite, unutterable, measureless resources, so that they did not need to go outside of Him for anything. “To them God willed to make known what are THE RICHES of the glory of THIS MYSTERY among the Gentiles: WHICH IS CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory” (Col. 1:27). The truth of this, known in power, is the sure and certain antidote for Laodicean pride, rationalistic theology, traditional religion, demon-possessed spiritualistic mediums, and every other form of opposition or counterfeit.<a id="calibre_link-31" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-73">13</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:3</span> <b class="calibre5">In</b> Christ <b class="calibre5">are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge</b>. The Gnostics, of course, boasted of an understanding far surpassing anything found within the pages of divine revelation. Their wisdom was something in addition to what was found in Christ or Christianity. But here Paul is saying that <b class="calibre5">all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge</b> are hidden in Christ, the Head. Therefore, there is no need for believers to go beyond what is written in the Scriptures. <b class="calibre5">The treasures</b> in Christ are hidden from unbelief; and even the believer needs to know Christ intimately to enter into them.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">Christ is <i class="calibre3">in</i> the believer as Head, center and resource. By the vastness of His unsearchable riches, by the pre-eminent wealth of His infinite greatness, by all that He is essentially as God, by all He has accomplished in creation and in redemption, by His personal, moral and official glories, He crowds out the whole army of professors, authors, mediums, critics, and all others arrayed against Him. (Selected)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">There is more in this verse than meets the eye. All <b class="calibre5">knowledge</b> is found in Christ. He is the incarnation of truth. He said: “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Nothing that is true will ever conflict with His words or His works. The difference between <b class="calibre5">knowledge</b> and <b class="calibre5">wisdom</b> has often been explained as follows: <b class="calibre5">Knowledge</b> is the understanding of truth, whereas <b class="calibre5">wisdom</b> is the ability to apply what truth has been learned.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:4</span> Because all wisdom and knowledge are in Christ, Christians should not be deluded with the <b class="calibre5">persuasive words</b> of false cultists. If a man does not have the truth, then he must seek to attract a following through the clever presentation of his message. That is exactly what heretics always do. They argue from probabilities and build a system of teaching on deductions. On the other hand, if a man is preaching the truth of God, then he does not need to depend on such things as eloquence or clever arguments. The truth is its own best argument and, like a lion, will defend itself.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:5</span> This verse shows how intimately aware the Apostle Paul was of the problems and perils facing the Colossians. He pictures himself as a military officer looking over the assembled troops as they stand ready for inspection. The two words <b class="calibre5">order</b> and <b class="calibre5">steadfastness</b> are military terms. The first describes the orderly array of a company of soldiers, whereas the second pictures the solid flank which is presented by them. Paul rejoices as he sees (<b class="calibre5">in spirit</b> though not in body) how the Colossians were standing true to the word of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:6</span> Now he encourages them to go on in the same way in which they had originally begun, that is, by faith. <b class="calibre5">As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him.</b> The emphasis here seems to be on the word <b class="calibre5">Lord</b>. In other words, they had acknowledged that in Him there was complete sufficiency. He was enough, not only for salvation, but for the whole of their Christian life. Now Paul urges the saints to go on acknowledging the lordship of Christ. They should not stray from Him by accepting the teachings of men, however convincing they may sound. The word <b class="calibre5">walk</b> is one that is often used of the Christian life. It speaks of action and progress. You cannot walk and remain in the same place. So it is in the Christian life; we are either going forward or backward.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:7</span> Paul first uses an expression from agriculture, then one from architecture. The expression <b class="calibre5">rooted</b> refers to what took place at the time of our conversion. It is as if the Lord Jesus Christ is the soil and we find our roots in Him, drawing all our nourishment from Him. This emphasizes, too, the importance of having our roots deep, so that when opposing winds blow, we will not be moved (Matt. 13:5, 20, 21).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Then Paul switches to the figure of a building. <b class="calibre5">Built up in Him.</b> Here the Lord Jesus is suggested as the foundation, and we are being <b class="calibre5">built</b> on <b class="calibre5">Him</b>, the Rock of Ages (Luke 6:47–49). We were <b class="calibre5">rooted</b> once for all, but we are being <b class="calibre5">built up</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And established in the faith.</b> The word <b class="calibre5">established</b> might also be translated “confirmed,” and the thought is that this is a process that goes on continuously through the Christian life. The Colossians had been taught the fundamentals of Christianity by Epaphras. As they continued on in the Christian pathway, these precious truths would be continually confirmed in their hearts and lives. Conversely, 2 Peter 1:9 indicates that failure to progress in spiritual life results in doubt and loss of the joy and blessing of the gospel.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul concludes this description with the words <b class="calibre5">abounding in it with thanksgiving</b>. He does not want Christians to be coldly doctrinal, but he wants their hearts to be captivated by the marvelous truths of the gospel so that they in turn will overflow in praise and thankfulness to the Lord. <b class="calibre5">Thanksgiving</b> for the blessings of Christianity is a wonderful antidote against the poison of false doctrine.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Arthur Way translates verse 7 as follows: “Be like trees fast-rooted, like buildings steadily rising, feeling His presence about you, and even (for to this your education has led up) unshaken in your faith, and overflowing with thanksgiving.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:8</span> Now Paul is ready to deal directly with the specific errors that had threatened the believers in the Lycus Valley, where Colosse was situated. <b class="calibre5">Beware lest anyone cheat you through philosophy and empty deceit.</b> False teachings seek to rob men of what is worthwhile, but offer nothing substantial in its place. <b class="calibre5">Philosophy</b> means literally “the love of wisdom.” It is not evil in itself, but becomes evil when men seek wisdom apart from the Lord Jesus Christ. Here the word is used to describe man’s attempt to find out by his own intellect and research those things which can only be known by divine revelation (1 Cor. 2:14). It is evil because it exalts human reason above God and worships the creature more than the Creator. It is characteristic of the liberals of our day, with their boasted intellectualism and rationalism. <b class="calibre5">Empty deceit</b> refers to the false and valueless teachings of those who profess to offer secret truths to an inner circle of people. There is really nothing to it. But it gathers a following by catering to man’s curiosity. Also it appeals to their vanity by making them members of the “select few.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The <b class="calibre5">philosophy and empty deceit</b> which Paul attacks are <b class="calibre5">according to the tradition of men, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to Christ. The tradition of men</b> here means religious teachings which have been invented by men but which have no true foundation in the Scriptures. (A tradition is a fixation of a custom which began as a convenience, or which suited some particular circumstance.) <b class="calibre5">The basic principles of the world</b> refer to Jewish rituals, ceremonies, and ordinances by which men hoped to obtain God’s favor.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The Law of Moses had served its purpose as a type of things to come. It had been a “primary school” to prepare the heart for the coming Christ. To return to it now would be to play into the hands of the false teachers who conspired to use a discarded system to displace the Son of God. (<i class="calibre3">Daily Notes of the Scripture Union</i>)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul would have the Colossians test all teaching by whether or not it agreed with the doctrines of <b class="calibre5">Christ</b>. Phillips’ translation of this verse is helpful: “Be careful that nobody spoils your faith through intellectualism or high sounding nonsense. Such stuff is at best founded on men’s ideas of the nature of the world, and disregards Christ!”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:9</span> It is marvelous to see how the Apostle Paul constantly brings his readers back to the Person of Christ. Here he gives one of the most sublime and unmistakable verses in the Bible on the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. <b class="calibre5">For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</b> Note the intended accumulation of evidence as to the fact that Christ is God. First of all, you have His deity: “For in Him dwells … <b class="calibre5">the Godhead bodily.”</b> Secondly, you have what someone has called the amplitude of deity: “For in Him dwells <i class="calibre3">the fullness of</i> <b class="calibre5">the Godhead bodily.”</b> Finally, you have what has been called the absolute completeness of deity: “For in Him dwells <i class="calibre3">all</i> <b class="calibre5">the fullness of the Godhead bodily.”</b> (This is an effective answer to the various forms of Gnosticism that deny the deity of the Lord Jesus—Christian Science, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Unity, Theosophy, Christadelphianism, etc.)</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Vincent says: “The verse contains two distinct assertions: (1) That the fulness of the Godhead eternally dwells in Christ … ; (2) The fulness of the Godhead dwells in Him … as one having a human body.”<a id="calibre_link-32" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-74">14</a> Many of the cults mentioned above would admit that some form of divinity dwelt in Jesus. This verse is identifying <b class="calibre5">all the fullness of the Godhead</b> with Him, in His manhood. The argument is clear—if there is such a sufficiency in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ, why be satisfied with teachings which slight or ignore Him?</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:10</span> The apostle is still trying to impress on his readers the all-sufficiency of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the perfect standing which they have <b class="calibre5">in Him</b>. It is a marvelous expression of the grace of God that the truth of verse 10 should follow that of verse 9. In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and the believer is <b class="calibre5">complete in Him</b>. This does not mean, of course, that the believer is indwelt by all the fullness of the Godhead. The only One of whom that was ever true, or ever shall be true, is the Lord Jesus Christ. But what this verse teaches is that the believer has in Christ all that is needed for life and godliness. Spurgeon gives a good definition of our completeness. He says we are (1) Complete without the aid of Jewish ceremony. (2) Complete without the help of philosophy. (3) Complete without the inventions of superstition. (4) Complete without human merit.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This One in whom we are complete <b class="calibre5">is the head of all principality and power</b>. The Gnostics were greatly taken up with the subject of angels. Mention of this is made later on in this chapter. But Christ is head over all the angelic beings, and it would be ridiculous to be occupied with angels when we can have the Creator of angels as the object of our affections and enjoy communion with Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:11</span> <b class="calibre5">Circumcision</b> was the typical rite of Judaism. It is a minor surgical operation in which the knife was applied to the flesh of the male child. Spiritually it signified death to the flesh, or a putting aside of the evil, corrupt, unregenerate nature of man. Unfortunately, the Jewish people became occupied with the literal ceremony but neglected its spiritual meaning. In trying to achieve favor with God through ceremonies and good works, they were saying in effect that there was something in human flesh which could please God. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">In the verse before us physical circumcision is not in view, but rather that spiritual <b class="calibre5">circumcision</b> which is true of everyone who has put his faith and trust in the Lord Jesus. This is clear from the expression <b class="calibre5">the circumcision made without hands</b>. What the verse is teaching is this: Every believer is circumcised <b class="calibre5">by the circumcision of Christ. The circumcision of Christ</b> refers to His death on the cross of Calvary. The thought is that when the Lord Jesus died, the believer died also. He died to sin (Rom. 6:11), to the law, to self (Gal. 2:20), and to the world (Gal. 6:14). (This circumcision was “made without hands” in the sense that human hands can have no part in it by way of merit. Man cannot deserve or earn it. It is God’s work.) Thus he has put off <b class="calibre5">the body of the sins of the flesh</b>. In other words, when a person is saved, he becomes associated with Christ in His death, and renounces any hope of earning or deserving salvation through fleshly efforts. Samuel Ridout writes: “Our Lord’s death has not only put away the fruit, but condemned and set aside the very root which bore it.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:12</span> Paul now turns from the subject of circumcision to that of <b class="calibre5">baptism</b>. Just as circumcision speaks of death to the flesh, even so <b class="calibre5">baptism</b> speaks of the burial of the old man. Thus we read: <b class="calibre5">Buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.</b> The teaching here is that we have not only died with Christ, but we have been <b class="calibre5">buried with Him</b>. This was typified at our baptism. It took place at the time of our conversion, but we expressed it in public confession when we went into the waters of baptism. Baptism is burial, the burial of all that we were as children of Adam. In baptism we acknowledge that nothing in ourselves could ever please God, and so we are putting the flesh out of God’s sight forever. But it does not end with burial. Not only have we been crucified with Christ and buried with Him, but we have also risen with Him to walk in newness of life. All of this takes place at the time of conversion. It is <b class="calibre5">through faith in the working of God, who raised</b> Christ <b class="calibre5">from the dead</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:13</span> The Apostle Paul now makes the application of all this to the Colossians. Before their conversion, they had been <b class="calibre5">dead in</b> their <b class="calibre5">trespasses</b>. This means that because of their sins, they were spiritually dead toward God. It does not mean that their spirits were dead, but simply that there was no motion in their spirits toward God and there was nothing they could do to win God’s favor. Not only were they <b class="calibre5">dead in</b> sins, but also Paul speaks of <b class="calibre5">the uncircumcision of</b> their <b class="calibre5">flesh. Uncircumcision</b> is often used in the NT to describe the Gentile peoples. The Colossians had been Gentiles. They had not been members of God’s earthly people, the Jews. Therefore, they had been in a position of distance from God, and had given full rein to the flesh with its lusts. But when they heard the gospel and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, they had been <b class="calibre5">made alive together with</b> Christ, and <b class="calibre5">all</b> their <b class="calibre5">trespasses</b> had been <b class="calibre5">forgiven</b>. In other words, what had really happened to the Colossians was that their whole lifestyle had been changed. Their history as sinners had come to an end, and now they were new creatures in Christ Jesus. They were living on the resurrection side. Therefore they should say “good-bye” to all that characterized them as men in the flesh.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:14</span> Paul now goes on to describe something else that was included in the work of Christ. <b class="calibre5">Having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. The handwriting of requirements that was against us</b> describes the law. In a sense, the Ten Commandments were against us, condemning us because we did not keep them perfectly. But the Apostle Paul is thinking not only about the Ten Commandments, but also about the ceremonial law that was given to Israel. In the ceremonial law, there were all kinds of commandments with regard to holy days, foods, and other religious rituals. These were all a part of the prescribed religion of the Jews. They pointed forward to the coming of the Lord Jesus. They were shadows of His Person and His work. In His death on the cross, He took all this out <b class="calibre5">of the way</b>, nailing it <b class="calibre5">to the cross</b> and canceling it as a bill is canceled when the debt is paid. As Meyer put it: “By the death of Christ on the cross, the law which condemned men lost its penal authority, inasmuch as Christ by His death endured for man the curse of the law and became the end of the law.”<a id="calibre_link-33" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-75">15</a> Kelly summarizes neatly: “The law is not dead, but we have died to it.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul’s language here very likely refers to an ancient practice of nailing the written evidence of a canceled debt in a public place as a notice to all that the creditor had no more claim on the debtor.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:15</span> By His death on the cross and His subsequent resurrection and ascension, the Lord Jesus also conquered evil <b class="calibre5">powers</b>, making <b class="calibre5">a public spectacle of them</b>, and <b class="calibre5">triumphing over them</b>. We believe that this is the same triumph that is described in Ephesians 4, where the Lord Jesus is said to have led captivity captive. His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension were a glorious triumph over all the hosts of hell and of Satan. As He passed up through the atmosphere on His way back to heaven, He passed through the very domain of the one who is the prince of the power of the air.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Perhaps this verse carries special comfort for those who have been converted from demonism but who might still be obsessed with a fear of evil spirits. There is nothing to fear if we are in Christ, because He has <b class="calibre5">disarmed principalities and powers.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:16</span> Once again the Apostle Paul is ready to make the application of what he has just been stating. We might summarize the foregoing as follows: The Colossians had died to all efforts to please God by the flesh. They had not only died but also had been buried with Christ and had risen with Christ to a new kind of life. Therefore they should be done forever with the Judaizers and Gnostics, who were trying to draw them back to the very things to which the Colossians had died. <b class="calibre5">So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths.</b> All human religions place men under bondage to ordinances, rules, regulations, and a religious calendar. This calendar usually includes annual observances (holy days), monthly festivals (new moons), or weekly holidays (sabbaths). The expression <b class="calibre5">“Therefore let no one judge you”</b> means that a Christian cannot be justly condemned by others if, for instance, he eats pork, or if he fails to observe religious festivals or holy days. Some false cults, such as Spiritism, insist on their members abstaining from meats. For centuries Roman Catholics were not supposed to eat meat on Friday. Many churches require abstinence from certain foods during Lent. Others, like the Mormons, say that a person cannot be a member in good standing if he drinks tea or coffee. Still others, notably the Seventh Day Adventists, insist that a person must keep the Sabbath in order to please God. The Christian is not under such ordinances. For a fuller treatment of the law, the Sabbath, and legalism, see the excurses at <a class="xref1" href="part0064_split_008.html#sb15">Matthew 5:18</a>, <a class="xref1" href="part0064_split_011.html#sb18">12:8</a>, and <a class="xref1" href="part0083_split_007.html#sb33">Galatians 6:18</a>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:17</span> The Jewish religious observances were <b class="calibre5">a shadow of things to come, but the substance</b> (or body) <b class="calibre5">is</b> Christ’s. They were instituted in the OT as a pre-picture. For instance, the Sabbath was given as a type of the rest which would be the portion of all who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. Now that the Lord Jesus has come, why should men continue to be occupied with the shadows? It is the same as being occupied with a picture when the very person pictured is present.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:18</span> It is rather difficult to know the exact meaning of this verse, because we are not fully acquainted with all that the Gnostics taught. Perhaps it means that these people pretended to be so humble that they would not dare to approach God directly. Perhaps the Gnostics taught that they must approach God through angels, and so in their supposed <b class="calibre5">humility</b> they worshiped <b class="calibre5">angels</b> rather than the Lord. We have something similar to this in the world today. There are Roman Catholics who say that they would not think of praying directly to God or to the Lord Jesus, and so their motto is “To Jesus through Mary.” This seems to be a <b class="calibre5">false humility</b> on their part and a worshiping of a created being. Christians should not allow anyone to rob them of their reward by such unscriptural practices. The word is clear that there is “one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5).</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The Apostle Paul goes on with the obscure expression: <b class="calibre5">intruding into those things which he has not</b><a id="calibre_link-34" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-76">16</a> <b class="calibre5">seen</b>. The Gnostics professed to have deep, secret mysteries, and in order to learn what these mysteries were, a person had to be initiated. Perhaps the secrets included many so-called visions. Supposed visions are an important element in such present-day heresies as Mormonism, Spiritism, Catholicism, and Swedenborgianism. Those who were members of the inner circle were naturally proud of their secret knowledge. Paul therefore adds: <b class="calibre5">Vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind</b>. They took a superior attitude toward others and created the impression that one could be happy only through entering into these deep secrets. We might pause here to say that much of this is characteristic of the secret fraternal organizations of our day. The Christian who is walking in fellowship with his Lord will have neither time nor sympathy for such organizations.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The important point to notice in this verse is that the various religious practices of these men were performed according to their own will. They had no scriptural authority. They did not act in subjection to Christ. They became <b class="calibre5">vainly puffed up by</b> the <b class="calibre5">mind</b> of their flesh because they were doing exactly what they themselves wanted to do, in independence of the Lord; yet their conduct appeared to be humble and religious.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:19</span> <b class="calibre5">And not holding fast to the Head.</b> The Lord Jesus is here spoken of as the <b class="calibre5">Head</b> of the Body. “To hold to the Head” means to live with the consciousness that Christ is <b class="calibre5">Head</b>, drawing the supply of all our needs from His exhaustless resources, and doing all for His glory. It means looking to the Lord in glory for sustenance and direction, and keeping in touch with Him. This is further explained in the expression that follows: <b class="calibre5">from whom all the body, nourished and knit together by joints and ligaments, grows with the increase that is from God</b>. The various parts of the human body are connected by <b class="calibre5">joints and ligaments</b>. The body in turn is joined to the head. The body looks to the head for guidance and direction. That is just the thought that the Apostle Paul is emphasizing here. The members of Christ’s Body on earth should find all their satisfaction and sufficiency in Him, and not be lured away by the convincing arguments of these false teachers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Holding fast to the Head</b> emphasizes the necessity for a moment-by-moment dependence on the Lord. Yesterday’s help will not do for today. We can’t grind grain with the water that has passed over the dam. It should also be added here that where Christians do hold to the Head, the result will be spontaneous action which will coordinate with other members of the Body.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:20</span> <b class="calibre5">The basic principles of the world</b>, as used in this verse, refer to rituals and ordinances. For instance, the rituals of the OT were rudiments of the world in the sense that they taught the elementary <b class="calibre5">principles</b> of religion, the ABCs (Gal. 4:9–11). Perhaps Paul is also thinking of the rituals and ordinances connected with Gnosticism and other religions. In particular, the apostle is dealing with asceticism, springing from a Judaism which had already <i class="calibre3">lost</i> its standing with God, or from Gnosticism or any other cult which <i class="calibre3">never</i> had any standing with God. Since the Colossians had <b class="calibre5">died with Christ</b>, Paul asks them why there was still a desire to <b class="calibre5">subject</b> themselves <b class="calibre5">to</b> such <b class="calibre5">regulations</b>; to do so would be to forget that they had severed their ties with the world. Perhaps the question will arise in some minds: “If a Christian is dead to ordinances, why does he still retain baptism and the Lord’s Supper?” The most obvious answer is that these two ordinances of the Christian Church are taught in the NT. However, they are not “means of grace,” making us more fit for heaven or helping us to gain merit before God. Rather, they are simple acts of obedience to the Lord, indicating respectively, identification with Christ and remembrance of Him in His death. They are not so much laws to be kept as privileges to be enjoyed.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:21</span> This verse is better understood if we supply the words “such as” at the beginning. In other words, Paul is saying in verse 20, “Why, as though living in the world, do you submit yourselves to regulations—such as (v. 21) <b class="calibre5">Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle?”</b> Strangely enough, some have taught that Paul was here <i class="calibre3">commanding</i> the Colossians not to touch, taste, or handle! This, of course, is the very opposite of the meaning of the passage.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It should be mentioned here that some authorities, such as William Kelly, believe that the order of the clauses in this verse should be: “Handle not; Neither taste; Nor even touch.” This order would describe an increasing severity in the practice of asceticism.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:22</span> The meaning is still further explained in verse 22. These are prohibitions which are manmade, as is indicated by the expression <b class="calibre5">according to the commandments and doctrines of men</b>. Is this the essence of true religion, to be occupied with meats and drinks, rather than with the living Christ Himself?</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Weymouth translates verses 20–22 as follows:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">If you have died with Christ and have escaped from the world’s rudimentary notions, why, as though your life still belonged to the world, do you submit to such precepts as “Do not handle this”; “Do not taste that”; “Do not touch that other thing”—referring to things which are all intended to be used up and to perish—in obedience to mere human injunctions and teachings?</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">2:23</span> <b class="calibre5">These</b> practices of man’s religion all create a seeming <b class="calibre5">appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility</b>, and severity to <b class="calibre5">the body. Self-imposed religion</b> means that these people adopt a form of worship according to their own ideas of what is right, rather than according to God’s word. They seem to be religious, but it is not true Christianity. <b class="calibre5">False humility</b> has already been explained—they pretend to be too humble to approach God directly, and so they use angelic mediators. <b class="calibre5">Neglect of the body</b> refers to the practice of asceticism. It is the belief that through self-denial or self-torture, man can achieve a higher state of holiness. This is found in Hinduism and other mystical religions of the East.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">What is the value of all these practices? Perhaps it is best expressed in the closing part of this verse: <b class="calibre5">of no value against the indulgence of the flesh</b>. All of these put on a fine appearance outwardly, but they do not succeed in checking <b class="calibre5">the indulgence of the flesh</b>. (Even the well-intentioned temperance pledges fail to achieve their goal.) Every false system utterly fails to make men better. While creating the impression that there is something the flesh can do to merit God’s favor, they are unable to restrain the passions and lusts of the flesh. The Christian attitude is that we have died to the flesh with all its passions and lusts, and from now on we live to the glory of God. We do this, not out of fear of punishment, but rather out of love to the One who gave Himself for us. A. T. Robertson put it well: “It is love that makes us really free to do right. Love makes the choice easy. Love makes the face of duty beautiful. Love makes it sweet to keep up with Christ. Love makes the service of goodness freedom.”</p>

      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">3:1</span> <b class="calibre5">If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God.</b> The <b class="calibre5">If</b> of this verse does not express any doubt in the mind of the Apostle Paul. It is what has been called the “If” of argument, and may be translated <i class="calibre3">since</i>: “Since then you were raised together with Christ….</p>
      <p class="calibre2">As mentioned in chapter 2, the believer is seen as having died with Christ, having been buried with Him, and having risen with Him from among the dead. The spiritual meaning of all this is that we have said good-bye to the former way of life, and have entered upon a completely new type of life, that is, the life of the risen Lord Jesus Christ. Because we have been <b class="calibre5">raised with Christ</b>, we should <b class="calibre5">seek those things which are above</b>. We are still on earth, but we should be cultivating heavenly ways.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:2</span> The Christian should not be earth-bound in his outlook. He should view things not as they appear to the natural eye but in reference to their importance to God and to eternity. Vincent suggests that “seek” in verse 1 marks the practical striving and that <b class="calibre5">set your mind</b> in verse 2 describes the inward impulse and disposition. The expression <b class="calibre5">set your mind</b> is the same as that in Philippians 3:19: “who set their mind on earthly things.” A. T. Robertson writes: “The baptized life means that the Christian is seeking heaven and is thinking heaven. His feet are upon the earth, but his head is with the stars. He is living like a citizen of heaven here on earth.”<a id="calibre_link-35" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-7">17</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2">During World War II, a young Christian enthusiastically reported to a mature servant of Christ, “I understand our bombers were over the enemy’s cities again last night.” To this, the older believer replied, “I did not know that the church of God had bombers.” He obviously was looking at things from the divine standpoint, rather than taking pleasure in the destruction of women and children.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">F. B. Hole explains our position clearly:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The counterpart to our identification with Christ in His death is our identification with Him in His resurrection. The effect of the first is to disconnect us from man’s world, man’s religion, man’s wisdom. The effect of the other is to put us into touch with God’s world and with all that is there. The first four verses of chapter III unfold the blessedness into which we are introduced.<a id="calibre_link-36" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-8">18</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:3</span> When Paul says that the believer has <b class="calibre5">died</b>, he is referring to position, and not to practice. Because of our identification with Christ in His death, God wants us to consider ourselves as having <b class="calibre5">died</b> with Him. Our own hearts are always ready to dispute this fact, because we feel so very much alive to sin and temptation. But the wonderful thing is that as we by faith reckon ourselves to have died with Christ, it becomes a moral reality in our lives. If we live as those who have died, then our lives will become increasingly conformed to the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. Of course, we will never reach perfection in this life, but it is a process that should be going on in every believer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only have we <b class="calibre5">died</b>, but also our <b class="calibre5">life is hidden with Christ in God</b>. The things that concern and interest the worldly man are found on this planet on which we live. However, the things that are of greatest concern to the believer are all bound up in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. His destiny and ours are inseparable. Paul’s thought is that since our <b class="calibre5">life is hidden with Christ in God</b>, we should not be occupying ourselves with the petty things of this world, and especially the religious world about us.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But there is another thought connected with the expression <b class="calibre5">your life is hidden with Christ in God</b>. The world does not see our spiritual life. Men do not understand us. They think it is strange that we do not live like they do. They do not comprehend our thoughts, our motives, or our ways. Just as it is said of the Holy Spirit that the world “neither sees Him, nor knows Him,” so it is with our spiritual life; it <b class="calibre5">is hidden with Christ in God</b>. First John 3:1 tells us: “Therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know Him.” The real separation from the world lies in the fact that the world does not understand, but rather misunderstands the believer.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:4</span> To climax his description of the believer’s portion in Christ, the apostle now looks on to Christ’s coming again. <b class="calibre5">When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.</b> At the present time we are raised with Him and enjoying a life that is not seen or understood by men. But the day is coming when the Lord Jesus will return for His saints. Then we <b class="calibre5">will appear with Him in glory</b>. Men will understand us then and realize why we behaved as we did.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:5</span> In verse 3, we were told that we died. Here we are told to <b class="calibre5">put to death</b> our <b class="calibre5">members which are on the earth</b>. In these two verses we have a very clear illustration of the difference between a believer’s standing and state. His standing is that he has died. His state should be that of reckoning himself dead to sin by putting <b class="calibre5">to death</b> his <b class="calibre5">members which are on the earth</b>. Our standing is what we are in Christ. Our state is what we are in ourselves. Our standing is the free gift of God through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Our state represents our response to God’s grace.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Here we should also notice the difference between law and grace. God does not say, “If you live a life of freedom from sin, then I will give you a position of death with Christ.” That would be law. Our position would depend on our own efforts, and needless to say, no one would ever attain that position. Instead of that, God says: “I freely give to all who believe on the Lord Jesus a position of favor in My sight. Now go out and live a life that is consistent with such a high calling.” That is grace!</p>
      <p class="calibre2">When the apostle says that we should <b class="calibre5">put to death</b> our <b class="calibre5">members which are on the earth</b>, he does <i class="calibre3">not</i> mean that we should literally destroy any of the members of our physical body! The expression is figurative, and is explained in the phrases that follow. The word <b class="calibre5">members</b> is used to signify the various forms of lust and hatred that are enumerated.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Fornication</b> is generally used to describe unlawful sexual intercourse or immorality, especially between single people (Matt. 15:19; Mark 7:21). Sometimes it is broader and is translated as sexual immorality. <b class="calibre5">Uncleanness</b> refers to impurity of thought, word, or action. It speaks of moral filth rather than physical dirtiness here. <b class="calibre5">Passion</b> denotes strong and unbridled lust. <b class="calibre5">Evil desire</b> speaks of intense and often violent craving. <b class="calibre5">Covetousness</b> in general means greediness or the desire to have more, but here it may refer especially to an unholy desire to satisfy sexual appetite which <b class="calibre5">is idolatry</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The list begins with acts and moves on to motives. The various forms of sexual sin are described, then they are traced to their lair, namely, the covetous heart of man. The word of God is clear in teaching that there is nothing inherently wrong in sex. God made man with the power for reproduction. But the sin comes when those things which God has so graciously bestowed upon His creatures are used for vile, illicit purposes. Sexual sin was the cardinal offense of the pagan world in Paul’s day, and doubtless it still holds first place. Where believers are not yielded to the Holy Spirit, sexual sins often come into their lives and prove their downfall.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:6</span> Men think that they can commit these outrageous sins and escape punishment. The heavens seem to be silent, and man increases in his boldness. But God is not mocked. <b class="calibre5">The wrath of God</b> comes down <b class="calibre5">upon the sons of disobedience</b> for these things. These sins have their consequences in this life; people reap in their own bodies the results of sexual immorality. In addition they will reap a terrible harvest of judgment in a day yet future.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:7</span> Paul reminds the Colossians that they once indulged in these sins before their conversion. But the grace of God had come in and delivered them from impurity. That was a chapter in their life which was now covered by the blood of Christ. They now had a new life which empowered them to live for God. See Galatians 5:25: “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:8</span> Since they had been redeemed at such a tremendous cost, they should now <b class="calibre5">put off</b> all these things like a dirty garment. Not only does the apostle refer to the various forms of unholy lust listed in verse 5, but also to the types of wicked hatred which he is about to enumerate.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Anger</b> is, of course, a strong spirit of dislike or animosity, a vengeful spirit, a settled feeling of hatred. <b class="calibre5">Wrath</b> describes an intense form of anger, probably involving violent outbursts. <b class="calibre5">Malice</b> is wicked conduct toward another with the idea of harming his person or reputation. It is an unreasonable dislike that takes pleasure in seeing others suffer. <b class="calibre5">Blasphemy</b> here means reviling, that is, strong, intemperate language used against another person. It means scolding in a harsh, insolent manner. <b class="calibre5">Filthy language</b> means shameful speaking, and describes that which is lewd, indecent, or corrupt. It is disgraceful, impure language. In this catalog of sin the apostle goes from motives to acts. Bitterness starts in the human heart and then manifests itself in the various ways which have been described.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:9</span> In verse 9 the apostle is saying in effect, “Let your state be consistent with your standing.” <b class="calibre5">You have put off the old man</b>; now put him off practically by refraining from lies. Lying is one of the things that belongs to <b class="calibre5">the old man</b>, and it has no place in the life of the child of God. Every day in our lives we are tempted to distort the truth. It may be by withholding information on an income tax form, or by cheating on an examination, or even by exaggerating the details of a story. Lying becomes doubly serious when we injure another by a false statement, or by creating a false impression.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:10</span> Not only have we put off the old man, but we <b class="calibre5">have put on the new man, who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him</b>. Just as the old man refers to all that we were as sons of Adam, with an unregenerate nature, so <b class="calibre5">the new man</b> refers to our new position as children of God. There has been a new creation, and we are new creatures. God’s purpose is that this new man should always be growing more and more like the Lord Jesus Christ. We should never be satisfied with our present attainments, but should always press on to the goal of increasing conformity to the Savior. He is our example and the rule of our lives. In a coming day, when we stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ, we will be judged not by how much better our lives were than others but rather by how our life measured up to the life of the Lord Jesus Himself.</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The image of God is not seen in the shape of our bodies, but in the beauty of the renewed mind and heart. Holiness, love, humility, meekness, kindness, and forgiveness—these make up the divine character. (<i class="calibre3">Daily Notes of the Scripture Union</i>)</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:11</span> In the new creation of which the apostle has been speaking, <b class="calibre5">there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all</b>. Differences of nationality, religion, culture, and social level are not the things that count. As far as standing before God is concerned, all believers are on the same level, and in local church fellowship this same attitude should be adopted.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This does not mean that there are no distinctions in the church. Some have the gift of evangelist, some of pastor, and some of teacher. Some men are elders in the church and some are deacons. Thus, the verse does not disparage proper distinctions.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Neither should the verse be taken to teach that the distinctions listed have been abolished in the world. Such is not the case. There is still the <b class="calibre5">Greek</b> and the <b class="calibre5">Jew, Greek</b> here standing for the Gentile peoples in general. There are <b class="calibre5">the circumcised</b> and <b class="calibre5">the uncircumcised</b>. These two expressions are generally used in the NT to describe Jew and Gentile respectively. However, here they might refer more particularly to the ritual itself as practiced by the Jewish people, and as disregarded by the Gentiles.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There is still the <b class="calibre5">barbarian</b> (uncultured person) and the <b class="calibre5">Scythian</b>. These two expressions are not here set in contrast to one another. The <b class="calibre5">Scythians</b> were barbarians, but were generally considered to be the more extreme form; they were the wildest and most savage of the barbarians. The final contrast is between <b class="calibre5">slave</b> and <b class="calibre5">free. Free</b> refers to those who never had been in bondage, but were born free. For the Christian these worldly distinctions are no longer of importance. It is Christ who really counts. He is everything to the believer and in everything. He represents the center and circumference of the Christian’s life.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Bishop Ryle states this truth boldly:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The three words—Christ is all—are the essence and substance of Christianity. If our hearts can really go along with them, it is well with our souls…. Many give Christ a certain place in their religion but not the place which God intended Him to fill. Christ alone is not “all in all” to their souls. No! It is either Christ and the church—or Christ and the sacraments—or Christ and His ordained ministers—or Christ and their own repentance—or Christ and their own goodness—or Christ and their own prayers—or Christ and their own sincerity and charity, on which they practically rest their souls.<a id="calibre_link-37" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-9">19</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:12</span> In verse 10, Paul said that we have put on the new man. Now he gives some practical ways in which this can be done in our everyday lives. First of all, he addresses the Colossians as <b class="calibre5">the elect of God</b>. This refers to the fact that they had been chosen by God in Christ before the foundation of the world. God’s electing grace is one of the mysteries of divine revelation. We believe the Scripture clearly teaches that God, in His sovereignty, has chosen men to belong to Christ. We do not believe that God has ever chosen anyone to be damned. Such a teaching is directly contrary to Scripture. Just as we believe in God’s electing grace, we also believe in man’s responsibility. God does not save men against their will. The same Bible that says “elect according to the foreknowledge of God” also says “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Next Paul addresses the Colossians as <b class="calibre5">holy and beloved. Holy</b> means sanctified, or set apart (same word as “saints”) to God from the world. We are positionally holy, and we should be practically holy in our lives as well. Because we are the objects of God’s love, it gives us a desire to please Him in every way.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Now Paul describes the Christian graces which we are to <b class="calibre5">put on</b> as a garment. <b class="calibre5">Tender mercies</b> speaks of a heart of compassion. <b class="calibre5">Kindness</b> speaks of the unselfish spirit of doing for others. It is an attitude of affection or goodwill. <b class="calibre5">Humility</b> means lowliness, the willingness to be humbled and to esteem others better than oneself. <b class="calibre5">Meekness</b> does not speak of weakness, but rather the strength to deny oneself and to walk in grace toward all men. Vine says:</p>
      <div class="blockquote">
        <p class="bqs">The common assumption is that when a man is meek, it is because he cannot help himself; but the Lord was “meek” because He had the infinite resources of God at His command. Described negatively, meekness is the opposite to self-assertiveness and self-interest; it is equanimity of spirit that is neither elated nor cast down, simply because it is not occupied with self at all.<a id="calibre_link-38" class="enref1" href="#calibre_link-10">20</a></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">If <b class="calibre5">humility</b> is the “absence of pride,” then <b class="calibre5">meekness</b> is “the absence of passion.” <b class="calibre5">Longsuffering</b> speaks of patience under provocation and of the long endurance of offense. It combines joy and a kind attitude toward others, along with perseverance in suffering.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:13</span> <b class="calibre5">Bearing with one another</b> describes the patience we should have with the failings and odd ways of our brethren. In living with others, it is inevitable that we will find out their failures. It often takes the grace of God for us to put up with the idiosyncrasies of others, as it must for them to put up with ours. But we must bear with one another. <b class="calibre5">Forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another.</b> There are few disputes among the people of God which could not be solved quickly if these injunctions were heeded. Forgiveness should be exercised toward others when they have offended. We often hear the complaint: “But he was the one who offended me….” That is exactly the type of situation in which we are called upon to forgive. If the other person had not offended us, there would have been no need for forgiveness. If we had been the one who had committed the offense, then we should have gone and asked for pardon. Forbearance suggests our not taking offense; forgiveness—not holding it. There could scarcely be any greater incentive to forgiveness than is found in this verse: <b class="calibre5">Even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.</b> How did <b class="calibre5">Christ</b> forgive us? He forgave us without a cause. So should we. He forgave us freely. So should we. He forgave and He forgot. So should we. Both as to manner and extent, we should follow our blessed Lord in this wonderful attitude.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:14</span> <b class="calibre5">Love</b> is here spoken of as the outer garment, or the belt, which binds all the other virtues together in order to make up <b class="calibre5">perfection</b>. It holds together in symmetry all parts of the Christian character. It is possible that a person might manifest some of the virtues above without really having love in his heart. And so Paul is emphasizing here that what we do must be done in a genuine spirit of <b class="calibre5">love</b> for our brethren. Our actions should not be grudging but should be born out of wholehearted affection. The Gnostics thought of knowledge as <b class="calibre5">the bond of perfection</b>, but Paul corrects this view by insisting that <b class="calibre5">love</b> is <b class="calibre5">the bond of perfection.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:15</span> <b class="calibre5">The peace of God</b> should act as an umpire <b class="calibre5">in</b> our <b class="calibre5">hearts</b>. If in anything we are in doubt, we should ask ourselves the questions: “Does it make for peace?” or “Would I have peace in my heart if I went ahead and did it?”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">This verse is especially helpful when seeking guidance from the Lord. If the Lord really wants you to embark upon a certain course of action, He will most assuredly give you <b class="calibre5">peace</b> about it. If you do not have that peace, then you should not proceed. As has been said: “Darkness about going is light about staying.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christ called us to enjoy His peace, both as individuals and also in the church. Do not overlook the importance of the latter part of this verse: <b class="calibre5">To which also you were called in one body.</b> One way in which we could enjoy peace would be to live in isolation from all other Christians. But this is not God’s purpose. He has set the solitary in families. God’s intention is that we should gather together in local churches. Although living with other Christians may try our patience at times, yet God in this way can develop virtues in the Christian’s life which He could not produce in any other manner. So we should not shirk our responsibilities in the local church, nor give them up when we are annoyed or provoked. Rather we should seek to live compatibly with our fellow believers and help them in all we do and say.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">And be thankful.</b> This refrain is repeated over and over again in Paul’s writings. There must have been a good reason: The Spirit of God must consider a <b class="calibre5">thankful</b> spirit very important. And we believe that it is!—important not only for a person’s spiritual life, but for his physical welfare as well. Doctors have found out what the Scriptures have taught through the years—that a cheerful, <b class="calibre5">thankful</b> attitude of mind is beneficial for the body, and that worry, depression, and a complaining spirit are definitely harmful to one’s health. Usually we think of thankfulness as something that is determined by our immediate circumstances, but Paul here shows that it is a grace to be cultivated. We are responsible to be <b class="calibre5">thankful</b>. Of all peoples of the world, we have the most for which to give thanks (compare Deut. 33:29). The fault is not in any lack of subject matter, but only in our selfish hearts.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:16</span> There is disagreement as to how verse 16 should be punctuated. There was no punctuation in the original language of the NT, and the meaning of such a verse as this is largely determined by the punctuation marks that are used. We suggest the following: <b class="calibre5">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another; in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</b></p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are thus three sections to the verse. First, we are to <b class="calibre5">let the word of Christ dwell in</b> us <b class="calibre5">richly. The word of Christ</b> refers to the teachings of Christ as found in the Bible. As we saturate our hearts and minds with His holy word, and seek to walk in obedience to it, then <b class="calibre5">the word of Christ</b> is really at home in our hearts.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The second thought is that <b class="calibre5">in all wisdom</b> we should be <b class="calibre5">teaching and admonishing one another</b>. Every Christian has a responsibility to his brothers and sisters in Christ concerning this matter. <b class="calibre5">Teaching</b> has to do with doctrine, whereas <b class="calibre5">admonishing</b> has to do with duty. We owe it to our brethren to share our knowledge of the Scripture with them, and to seek to help by practical and godly counsel. When <b class="calibre5">teaching and admonishing</b> are given <b class="calibre5">in wisdom</b>, they are more likely to find acceptance than when we speak with force but unwisely or without love.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The third thing is that with <b class="calibre5">psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</b> we should sing <b class="calibre5">with grace in</b> our <b class="calibre5">hearts to the Lord. Psalms</b> describe those inspired utterances which are found in the book by that name, which were sung as part of Israel’s worship. <b class="calibre5">Hymns</b>, on the other hand, are generally understood as songs of worship and praise addressed to God the Father or to the Lord Jesus Christ. For example:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">Jesus! the very thought of Thee</p>
        <p class="sl">With sweetness fills my breast;</p>
        <p class="sl">But sweeter far Thy face to see,</p>
        <p class="sl">And in Thy presence rest.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="paft">These <b class="calibre5">hymns</b> are not inspired in the same sense as the <b class="calibre5">psalms. Spiritual songs</b> refer to religious poetry describing Christian experience. An illustration of this might be found in the words:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">O what peace we often forfeit,</p>
        <p class="sl">O what needless pain we bear,</p>
        <p class="sl">All because we do not carry</p>
        <p class="sl">Everything to God in prayer.</p>
        <p class="slt">—<i class="calibre3">Joseph Scriven</i></p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2">Using these various types of songs we should sing <b class="calibre5">with grace</b> or thanksgiving, <b class="calibre5">in</b> our <b class="calibre5">hearts to the Lord</b>. At this point it might be well to say that the Christian should use discernment in the type of music he uses. Much of the so-called “Christian” music of today is light and frothy. A great deal of this music is utterly contrary to Scripture, and still more is so similar to the world’s “pop” and rock that it is a discredit to the name of Christ.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Verse 16 is very similar to Ephesians 5:18, 19, where we read: “And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.” In Colossians 3:16, the main difference is that instead of saying “be filled with the Spirit,” Paul says: <b class="calibre5">“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.”</b> In other words, being filled with the Spirit and being filled with God’s word are both requisites for living joyful, useful, fruitful lives. We shall not be filled with the Spirit unless we are saturated with God’s word; and the study of God’s word will not be effective unless we yield up our inmost being to the control of the Holy Spirit. Can we not therefore conclude that to be filled with the Spirit means to be filled with God’s word? It is not some mysterious, emotional crisis that comes in the life, but rather day by day feeding on the Scriptures, meditating on them, obeying them, and living by them.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:17</span> Verse 17 is an all-inclusive rule by which to judge our conduct as Christians. Young people today especially have a difficult time deciding whether certain things are right or wrong. This verse, committed to memory, can prove to be the key for unlocking many of these problems. The great test should be: Can I do this <b class="calibre5">in the name of the Lord Jesus</b> Christ? Would this be to His glory? Could I expect His blessing to rest on it? Would I want to be doing it when He comes back again? Notice that this test should apply to the words we speak and to the deeds we do. Obedience to this command ennobles all of life. It is a precious secret when the Christian learns to do all as to the Lord and for His glory. Once again the apostle adds the word, <b class="calibre5">“Giving thanks to God the Father through Him.”</b> Thanks! <i class="calibre3">Thanks</i>! <b class="calibre5">Thanks</b>! It is a perpetual duty for those saved by grace and destined for the courts of heaven.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-53" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-11">B. Appropriate Behavior for Members of the Christian Household (3:18—4:1)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft">Paul now gives a series of exhortations to members of the Christian household. The series continues through 4:1. He has advice for wives and husbands, for children and parents, and for servants and masters. At first, it may seem like an abrupt change to turn from the subjects which have occupied Paul to such mundane matters as home life. But actually this is most significant.</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <p class="fig"><img src="00001.jpeg" alt="" class="calibre6"/></p>
      </div>
      <div id="calibre_link-94" class="sidebar">
        <p class="sbt"><a class="xref" href="part0002.html#rsb36">THE CHRISTIAN HOME</a></p>
        <p class="sbaft">God considers the home to be a very important force in the Christian life. The well-known statement “The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world” has truth in it beyond what appears on the surface. The family unit was designed by God for the preservation of much that is worthwhile in life. As less and less attention is devoted to the home, even so our civilization deteriorates rapidly. Paul’s first Letter to Timothy teaches in a special way that God has ordained home life as the means of developing spiritual qualities, so that one’s fitness for leadership in the church grows out of his proved character in the home.</p>
        <p class="sb">In the verses to follow we have some of the fundamental principles to guide in the establishment of a Christian home. In studying this section, we should be aware of the following “musts.”</p>
        <ol class="calibre4">
          <li class="sbnlf" value="1">1. There must be a family altar—a time each day when the family gathers for the reading of the Holy Scriptures and for prayer.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="2">2. The father must have his place of authority in the home, and he must exercise it in wisdom and love.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="3">3. The wife and mother should realize that her first responsibility to God and to the family is in the home. In general, it is not wise for the wife to have an outside job. There are, of course, exceptional cases.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="4">4. The husband and wife should present a godly example to their children. They should be united on all matters, including the disciplining of the children, when necessary.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="5">5. The family unit should be maintained. It is all too possible to become so engrossed in business, social life, and even in Christian service that the children suffer from lack of affection, companionship, instruction, and discipline. Many parents have had to confess mournfully over a wayward son or daughter: “And while your servant was busy here and there, he was gone” (1 Kgs. 20:40).</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="6">6. With regard to the disciplining of children, three cardinal rules have been suggested. Never punish in anger. Never punish unjustly. Never punish without explaining the reason.</li>
          <li class="sbnl" value="7">7. It is good for children to learn to bear the yoke in their youth (Lam. 3:27), to learn the discipline of work and of accepting responsibility, and the value of money.</li>
          <li class="sbnll" value="8">8. Above all, Christian parents should avoid being ambitious for their children in a carnal, worldly way, but should constantly hold before them the service of our Lord as the most profitable way in which to spend their lives. For some, it might mean full-time service on a mission field; for others, it might mean service for the Lord in a secular occupation. But in either case, work for the Lord should be the primary consideration. Whether at home, at work, or wherever we may be, we should be conscious of the fact that we represent our Savior, and so every word and act should be worthy of Him, and should, in fact, be governed by Him.</li>
        </ol>

      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:18</span> The first injunction of the apostle is addressed to <b class="calibre5">wives</b>. They are enjoined to <b class="calibre5">submit to</b> their <b class="calibre5">own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord</b>. According to the divine plan, the husband is head of the house. The woman has been given the place of submission to her husband. She is not to dominate or to lead, but to follow his leadership, wherever she can do so without compromising her loyalty to Christ. There are, of course, instances in which the woman cannot obey her husband and still be faithful to Christ. In such an instance, her first loyalty is to the Lord Jesus. Where a Christian woman has a backward husband, this verse indicates that she should help him to fulfill his proper place in the home, rather than for her to usurp it because she may be more clever.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:19</span> The balance which is presented to us in the word of God is beautiful. The apostle does not stop with this advice to wives; he now goes on to show that <b class="calibre5">husbands</b>, too, have a responsibility. They are to <b class="calibre5">love</b> their <b class="calibre5">wives, and not</b> to <b class="calibre5">be bitter toward them</b>. If these simple precepts were followed, many of the problems of married life would disappear, and homes would be happier in the Lord. Actually no wife would be likely to object to submitting to a husband who truly loves her. It has been noted that the husband is not told to make his wife obey him. If she does not, he should take it to the Lord. The submission should be her voluntary act “as is fitting in the Lord.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:20</span> <b class="calibre5">Children</b> are admonished: <b class="calibre5">obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord</b>. In all ages, families have been held together by two simple principles—authority and obedience. Here we have the latter. Notice that this obedience is to be <b class="calibre5">in all things</b>. This means not only in the things that are agreeable, but those which are not so naturally pleasing.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Christian children who have unsaved parents are often placed in a difficult position. They want to be true to the Lord, and yet at the same time they are faced with demands made upon them by their parents. In general, we feel that if they honor their parents, God will in turn honor them. As long as they are living in the home of their parents, they have a very definite obligation to perform. Of course, they should not do anything that would be contrary to the teachings of Christ, but ordinarily they would not be called upon to do such. Often they will be called upon to do things that might seem very distasteful to them, but as long as it is not distinctly wrong or sinful, they can determine to do it as to the Lord. In this way they can be a good testimony to their parents and seek to win them to the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:21</span> <b class="calibre5">Fathers</b> should <b class="calibre5">not provoke</b> their <b class="calibre5">children, lest they become discouraged</b>. It is interesting that this advice is addressed to <b class="calibre5">fathers</b> and not to mothers. Does it not reveal that the danger of a father committing this fault is greater than that of a mother? Kelly suggests that mothers are probably more prone to spoil the children.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:22</span> From verse 22 to the end of the chapter, the Spirit of God addresses <b class="calibre5">bondservants</b> or slaves. It is interesting to note the amount of space devoted in the NT to slaves. This is not without significance. It shows that no matter how low a person’s social status may be, he still can attain the very highest in the Christian life through faithfulness to the word of God. Perhaps it also reflects the foreknowledge of God that most Christian people would occupy places of service rather than positions of authority. For instance, there is very little instruction in the NT that refers to rulers of nations, but there is considerable advice for those who devote their lives in the service of others. Slaves in the days of Paul usually received very little consideration, and doubtless it struck the early Christians as unusual that so much attention was given to them in these Letters. But it shows how the grace of God reaches down to men, no matter how menial their position might be. C. H. Mackintosh notes: “The slave is not shut out from the service of God. By simply doing his duty in the sight of God, he can adorn the doctrine and bring glory to God.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Bondservants</b> are told to <b class="calibre5">obey in all things</b> those who are their <b class="calibre5">masters according to the flesh</b>. There is a gentle reminder here that these masters are only <b class="calibre5">masters according to the flesh</b>. They have another Master who is above all and who sees all that is done to the lowliest of His children. Slaves are not to serve <b class="calibre5">with eyeservice, as menpleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God</b>. (For a good example of this in the OT, see Genesis 24:33.) Especially when a person is oppressed, it is a temptation to slack off in work when the master is not looking. But the Christian servant will realize that his Master is always looking, and so even though his earthly circumstances may be very bitter, he will work as to the Lord. <b class="calibre5">In sincerity of heart</b> means that he will have a pure motive—only to please the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">It is interesting that there is no express prohibition against slavery in the NT. The gospel does not overthrow social institutions by revolution. However, wherever the gospel has gone, slavery has been uprooted and eliminated. This does not mean that these instructions are therefore without meaning for us. All that is said here may very well be applied to employees and employers.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:23</span> <b class="calibre5">Whatever</b> is done should be done <b class="calibre5">heartily</b> (lit. “from the soul”) <b class="calibre5">as to the Lord and not to men</b>. In every form of Christian service as well as in every sphere of life, there are many tasks which people find obnoxious. Needless to say, we try to avoid such work. But this verse teaches us the very important lesson that the humblest service can be glorified and dignified by doing it for the Lord. In this sense, there is no difference between secular and sacred work. All is sacred. Rewards in heaven will not be for prominence or apparent successes; they will not be for talents or opportunities; but rather for faithfulness. Thus obscure persons will fare very well in that day if they have carried out their duties faithfully as to the Lord. Two mottoes which are often hung over the kitchen sink are: “Not somehow, but triumphantly,” and “Divine service held here three times daily.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:24</span> <b class="calibre5">The Lord</b> is keeping the records at the present time, and everything done as to Him will command His attention. “The kindness of God will repay the kindness of men.” Those who have little of earthly inheritance <b class="calibre5">will receive the reward of the inheritance</b> in heaven. Let us remember this the next time we are called upon to do something that we do not like to do, whether in the church, in the home, or at work; it is a testimony for Christ to do it uncomplainingly, and to do the best possible job.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">3:25</span> Paul does not specify just whom he has in mind in verse 25. Perhaps we would most naturally think of an unjust master, one who oppresses his servants. Maybe a Christian servant has become weary of obeying his unjust demands. “Never mind,” Paul is saying, “the Lord knows all about it, and He will take care of the wrongs, too.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">But although this might include masters, it is addressed primarily to servants. Slipshod service, cheating, loafing, or other forms of insincerity will not go unnoticed. <b class="calibre5">There is no partiality</b> with God. He is the Master of all, and the distinctions that prevail among men mean nothing to Him. If slaves rob their masters (as Onesimus apparently did), they will have to give an account to the Lord.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:1</span> This verse logically goes with the closing verse of chapter 3. <b class="calibre5">Masters</b> should <b class="calibre5">give</b> their <b class="calibre5">bondservants what is just and fair</b>. They should not withhold from them a proper wage, but should pay them well for the work they have done. This is addressed directly to Christian employers. God hates the oppression of the poor, and the gifts of a man who has grown rich through unfair labor practices are unacceptable to the Lord. God says in effect: “You keep your money; I don’t like the way you made it” (see Jas. 5:1–4). Masters should not be high-minded but should fear. They <b class="calibre5">also have a Master in heaven</b>, One who is just and righteous in all His ways.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Before closing this section it is interesting to note how the Apostle Paul repeatedly brings these matters of everyday life under the searchlight of the lordship of Christ as follows: (1) Wives—as is fitting in the Lord (v. 18). (2) Children—well-pleasing to the Lord (v. 20). (3) Servants—fearing the Lord (v. 22). (4) Servants—as to the Lord (v. 23).</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-54" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-12">C. The Believer’s Prayer Life and Witness by Life and Speech (4:2–6)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:2</span> Paul never tires of exhorting the people of God to be diligent in their <b class="calibre5">prayer</b> life. Doubtless one of the regrets we all will have when we get to heaven will be that we did not spend more time in prayer, especially when we will realize the extent to which our prayers were answered. There is a great deal of mystery in connection with the whole subject of prayer, many questions which cannot be answered. But the best attitude for the Christian is not to seek to analyze, dissect, or understand prayer’s deeper mysteries. The best approach is to keep praying in simple faith, leaving aside one’s intellectual doubts.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Not only are we to <b class="calibre5">continue earnestly in prayer</b>, but we are also to be <b class="calibre5">vigilant in it</b>. This immediately reminds us of the Lord Jesus’ request to the disciples in the Garden of Gethsemane: “Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.” They were not vigilant, and so fell sound asleep. We are to watch not only against sleep, but also against wandering thoughts, listlessness, and unreality. And we are to watch to see that we are not robbed of time for prayer (Eph. 6:18). Then again, our prayers are to be <b class="calibre5">with thanksgiving</b>. Not only are we to be thankful for past answers to prayer, but in faith we can also thank the Lord for prayers He has not answered. Guy King summarizes nicely: “His love wants the best for us; His wisdom knows the best for us; and His power gets the best for us.”<a id="calibre_link-39" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-13">21</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:3</span> Paul asks that the Colossians remember to pray <b class="calibre5">also for</b> him, and for the servants of the Lord who are with him in Rome. It is beautiful to notice that he does not ask that he might be released from prison, but rather <b class="calibre5">that God would open a door</b> to him for preaching <b class="calibre5">the word</b>. The apostle wanted God to open doors for him. What an important lesson there is for us in this! It is all too possible for us to go around opening doors for ourselves in Christian service. But this is a peril to be avoided. If the Lord opens the doors for us, then we can confidently enter them, knowing that He is leading. On the other hand, if we open the doors for ourselves, then we cannot be sure that we are in the center of the Lord’s will, and we might soon be stooping to carnal means to carry on the so-called work of the Lord. Paul’s specific request is that <b class="calibre5">a door for the word</b> might be opened to him <b class="calibre5">to speak the mystery of Christ, for which</b> he was <b class="calibre5">in chains</b>. The <b class="calibre5">mystery of Christ</b> in this verse is the truth of the church, and particularly that aspect of it which might be defined by the expression “Christ for the Gentiles.” That was the special aspect of the gospel message which had been committed to Paul to preach. It was because he dared to suggest that Gentiles could be saved in the same way as Jews that the Jewish leaders finally succeeded in having him sent to Rome as a prisoner.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">There are some who teach that the great mystery of the church was revealed to Paul while he was in prison. They therefore put great emphasis on the “Prison Epistles” while seeming to underestimate the importance of the Gospels and other books of the NT. But it is clear from this verse that the preaching of the mystery was the <i class="calibre3">cause</i> of his imprisonment and therefore must have been revealed to him some time before his arrest.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:4</span> He is anxious to <b class="calibre5">make it manifest</b>, that is, to preach it in such a clear manner that it will be readily understood by the people. This should be the desire of every Christian who seeks to make Christ known. There is no virtue in being “deep.” We should aim to reach the masses of humanity, and, in order to do so, the message must be presented simply and clearly.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:5</span> Christians should <b class="calibre5">walk in wisdom toward those who are outside</b>. In their everyday behavior, they should realize that they are being carefully watched by unbelievers. The world is more interested in our walk than in our talk. In the language of Edgar Guest: “I’d rather see a sermon, than hear one, any day.” This does not mean that the Christian should not also confess Christ with his lips, but the point is that his walk should correspond with his talk. It should never be said of him, “High talk, low walk.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Redeeming the time</b> means “buying up opportunities.” Every day of our lives we face opportunities for witnessing to the saving power of the Lord Jesus Christ. As these opportunities come along, we should be ready to snap them up. The word “buying” implies that there is often a cost involved. But whatever the cost may be, we should be ready to share our precious Savior with those who do not know Him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:6</span> Our <b class="calibre5">speech</b> should <b class="calibre5">always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that</b> we <b class="calibre5">may know how</b> we <b class="calibre5">ought to answer each one</b>. If our conversation is to be always <b class="calibre5">with grace</b>, it must be courteous, humble, and Christlike. It should be free from gossip, frivolity, uncleanness, and bitterness. The expression <b class="calibre5">seasoned with salt</b> may have a number of meanings. Some commentators think that although our language should be gracious, it should be equally honest and without hypocrisy. Others think of <b class="calibre5">salt</b> as that which heightens flavor, and so Paul is saying that our conversation should never be dull, flat, or insipid, but should always be worthwhile and profitable. Lightfoot says that heathen writers used “salt” as a figure of speech for “wit.” Paul changes wit to wisdom. Perhaps the best way to explain the expression is to study the language of the Lord Jesus. To the woman taken in the act of adultery, He said: “Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.” Here we have the grace and the salt. First of all, the grace, “neither do I condemn you”; then the salt, “go, and sin no more.” Then again the Lord Jesus said to the woman at Jacob’s well: “Give Me a drink…. Go, call your husband.” The first speaks of grace, whereas the second reminds us more of salt.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">That you may know how you ought to answer each one.</b> Perhaps the Apostle Paul is here thinking particularly of the Gnostics who came to the Colossians with their plausible doctrines. They should be ready to <b class="calibre5">answer</b> these false teachers with words of wisdom and faithfulness.</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-55" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-14">D. Glimpses of Some of Paul’s Associates (4:7–14)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:7</span> <b class="calibre5">Tychicus</b> was apparently the one who was chosen by the Apostle Paul to carry this Letter from Rome to Colosse. Maclaren pictures how amazed Tychicus would have been if told that “these bits of parchment would outlast all the ostentatious pomp of the city, and that his name, because written in them, would be known to the end of time all over the world.”</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul here assures the saints that when Tychicus arrives he will <b class="calibre5">tell</b> them <b class="calibre5">all the news</b> of the apostle’s affairs. Again it is nice to read the combination of titles which Paul bestows on this brother. He calls him <b class="calibre5">a beloved brother, faithful minister, and fellow servant in the Lord</b>. How much more to be coveted are titles such as these than high-sounding ecclesiastical names that are given to church officials in our day!</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:8</span> Tychicus’ trip to Colosse would serve two purposes. First of all, he would give the saints a firsthand account of Paul and his companions in Rome, and also he would <b class="calibre5">comfort</b> the <b class="calibre5">hearts</b> of the Colossians. Here again, <b class="calibre5">comfort</b> probably has more the idea of “strengthen” or “encourage” (see 2:2) than that of consoling. His ministry to them would have the general effect of helping them to stand against the false teaching that was then prevalent.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:9</span> The mention of the name <b class="calibre5">Onesimus</b> brings before us the lovely story unfolded in Paul’s Letter to Philemon. Onesimus was the runaway slave who sought to escape from punishment by fleeing to Rome. Somehow he had come in contact with Paul, who, in turn, had pointed him to Christ. Now Onesimus is going to travel back to his former master, Philemon, in Colosse. He will carry Paul’s Letter to Philemon, while Tychicus carries the Letter to the church at Colosse. Picture the excitement among the believers in Colosse when these two brethren arrived with the Letters from Paul! Doubtless they sat up late in the evening, asking questions about conditions in Rome and hearing of Paul’s courage in the service of his Savior.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:10</span> Not much is known about <b class="calibre5">Aristarchus</b> except that he had previously been arrested in connection with his service for the Lord, as recorded in Acts 19:29. Now he is Paul’s <b class="calibre5">fellow prisoner</b> in Rome.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Mark</b> is here spoken of as <b class="calibre5">the cousin of Barnabas</b>. This young man had started out with Paul and Barnabas in missionary labors. Because of his failure, Paul decided that he should be left at home, but Barnabas insisted on taking him with him. This caused a rift between the two older workers. However, it is good to learn that Mark’s failure was not final, and he is now restored to the confidence of the beloved Paul.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">If Mark should visit Colosse, the saints there are told to <b class="calibre5">welcome him</b>. The expression <b class="calibre5">about whom you received instructions</b> does not necessarily mean that the Colossians had previously received instructions concerning Mark. It may refer to the instructions which Paul is now giving to them: <b class="calibre5">If he comes to you, welcome him</b>. The tense of the verb <b class="calibre5">received</b> may simply mean that by the time the Colossians read this Letter, they would have received instructions. The mention of Mark, the writer of the Second Gospel, reminds us that we are <i class="calibre3">all</i> writing a gospel day by day:</p>
      <div class="senseline">
        <p class="slf">We each write a gospel, a chapter a day,</p>
        <p class="sl">By deeds, looks and likes, the things that we say,</p>
        <p class="sl">Our actions betray us—words faithful and true—</p>
        <p class="sll">Say, “What is the gospel according to you?”</p>
      </div>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:11</span> Another co-worker of Paul is spoken of as <b class="calibre5">Jesus, who is called Justus. Jesus</b> was a common name then, as it still is in certain countries. It was the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name “Joshua.” No doubt this man was <b class="calibre5">called Justus</b> because his Christian friends would feel the incongruity of anyone having the same name as the Son of God.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">The three foregoing men were all converted Jews. Indeed they were the <b class="calibre5">only</b> three former Jews who were <b class="calibre5">fellow workers</b> with Paul <b class="calibre5">for the kingdom of God</b>, men who had <b class="calibre5">proved to be a comfort to</b> him.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:12</span> As Paul is bringing his Letter to a close, <b class="calibre5">Epaphras</b> reminds him to be sure to send his own personal greetings to the dear saints in Colosse. Epaphras, a native of Colosse, was constantly remembering the believers <b class="calibre5">in</b> his <b class="calibre5">prayers</b>, asking the Lord that they might <b class="calibre5">stand perfect and complete in all the will of God</b>.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:13</span> Paul bears <b class="calibre5">witness</b> to the fact <b class="calibre5">that</b> Epaphras travailed in prayer not only for those in Colosse, but also for the Christians <b class="calibre5">in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis</b>. This man had a personal interest in the people of God with whom he was acquainted. Doubtless he had a very long prayer list, and it would not be at all surprising if he remembered each one in prayer every day. “He prays hard for you all the time, that you may stand fast, ripe in conviction, and wholly devoted to doing God’s will” (NEB).</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:14</span> Now Paul sends greetings from <b class="calibre5">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas</b>. Here we have a study in contrasts. <b class="calibre5">Luke</b> had traveled with Paul considerably and had probably ministered to him both physically and spiritually during his times of sickness, persecution, and imprisonment.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre5">Demas</b>, on the other hand, had gone on with the apostle for a while, but it was necessary at last for the apostle to say of him: “Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and has departed for Thessalonica” (2 Tim. 4:10).</p>
      <h3 id="calibre_link-56" class="bh"><a class="xref" href="#calibre_link-15">E. Greetings and Instructions (4:15–18)</a></h3>
      <p class="paft"><span class="calibre5">4:15</span> Greetings are now sent to <b class="calibre5">the brethren who are in Laodicea</b>, to <b class="calibre5">Nymphas, and the church that</b> was <b class="calibre5">in his house</b>. We read again of the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3:14–22. The church there became lukewarm about the things of God. It became utterly materialistic and self-satisfied. Thinking that all was well, the people did not realize their own nakedness. Manuscripts differ as to whether Nymphas (a man) or Nympha (a woman) is addressed. But it is sufficient to notice that there was a church in that home in Colosse. In those days the Christians did not have elaborate edifices such as are used today. However, most of us will readily agree that the power of God in a local church is far more important than an elaborate building or fine furnishings. Power is not dependent upon the latter; luxurious church buildings often serve as a hindrance to power.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:16</span> <b class="calibre5">When this epistle</b> had been <b class="calibre5">read</b> in Colosse, it was to be sent to <b class="calibre5">the church of the Laodiceans</b> to be read there also. Undoubtedly this was done, but from what we learn in Revelation 3, it seems that the Laodiceans did not heed the message of this Letter, at least in a lasting way.</p>
      <p class="calibre2">Paul also directs that <b class="calibre5">the epistle from Laodicea</b> should be read in Colosse. There is no way of knowing what Letter is referred to. Some believe that Paul’s so-called Letter to the Ephesians was the one in view. Some ancient manuscripts omit the words “in Ephesus” in Ephesians 1:1. This has led commentators to believe that the Letter to the Ephesians might have been a circular Letter which was supposed to be read in several different churches—for instance, Ephesus, Laodicea, then Colosse. This view is also strengthened by the fact that so few personal references are made in <i class="calibre3">Ephesians</i> compared to the number made in Colossians.<a id="calibre_link-40" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-16">22</a></p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:17</span> <b class="calibre5">Archippus</b> is told to <b class="calibre5">take heed to the ministry which</b> he had <b class="calibre5">received in the Lord</b>, and to <b class="calibre5">fulfill it</b>. Here again, we do not have definite information as to what <b class="calibre5">ministry</b> is referred to. Many have believed that <b class="calibre5">Archippus</b> was a son of Philemon, and that he was active in the church at Colosse. The verse will become much more meaningful to us if we assume that our name is Archippus, and if we hear the Spirit of God saying to us: <b class="calibre5">“Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.”</b> Each one of us has been given some service by the Lord, and we will some day be required to give an account of what we have done with it.</p>
      <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre5">4:18</span> At this point, the apostle took the pen in his <b class="calibre5">own hand</b> and signed his closing <b class="calibre5">salutation</b> with his Gentile name <b class="calibre5">Paul</b>. Doubtless as he did so the <b class="calibre5">chains</b> on his hands proved an inconvenience in writing, but it reminded him to say to the Colossians: <b class="calibre5">Remember my chains</b>. “The sound of pen and chains together is the final sign that the preacher’s chains cannot bind the Word of God.”<a id="calibre_link-41" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-17">23</a> Then he closed the Epistle with the words <b class="calibre5">Grace be with you. Amen.</b> A. T. Robertson writes: “There is no richer word than the word ‘grace,’ for it carries in it all of God’s love as seen in the gift of His Son for us.”<a id="calibre_link-42" class="enref" href="#calibre_link-18">24</a> <b class="calibre5">Amen</b>.</p>
